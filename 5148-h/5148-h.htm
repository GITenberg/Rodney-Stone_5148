<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">FRIAR&rsquo;S OAK.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> this, the first of January of
the year 1851, the nineteenth century has reached its midway
term, and many of us who shared its youth have already warnings
which tell us that it has outworn us.&nbsp; We put our grizzled
heads together, we older ones, and we talk of the great days that
we have known; but we find that when it is with our children that
we talk it is a hard matter to make them understand.&nbsp; We and
our fathers before us lived much the same life, but they with
their railway trains and their steamboats belong to a different
age.&nbsp; It is true that we can put history-books into their
hands, and they can read from them of our weary struggle of two
and twenty years with that great and evil man.&nbsp; They can
learn how Freedom fled from the whole broad continent, and how
Nelson&rsquo;s blood was shed, and Pitt&rsquo;s noble heart was
broken in striving that she should not pass us for ever to take
refuge with our brothers across the Atlantic.&nbsp; All this they
can read, with the date of this treaty or that battle, but I do
not know where they are to read of ourselves, of the folk we
were, and the lives we led, and how the world seemed to our eyes
when they were young as theirs are now.</p>
<p>If I take up my pen to tell you about this, you must not look
for any story at my hands, for I was only in my earliest manhood
when these things befell; and although I saw something of the
stories of other lives, I could scarce claim one of my own.&nbsp;
It is the love of a woman that makes the story of a man, and many
a year was to pass before I first looked into the eyes of the
mother of my children.&nbsp; To us it seems but an affair of
yesterday, and yet those children can now reach the plums in the
garden whilst we are seeking for a ladder, and where we once
walked with their little hands in ours, we are glad now to lean
upon their arms.&nbsp; But I shall speak of a time when the love
of a mother was the only love I knew, and if you seek for
something more, then it is not for you that I write.&nbsp; But if
you would come out with me into that forgotten world; if you
would know Boy Jim and Champion Harrison; if you would meet my
father, one of Nelson&rsquo;s own men; if you would catch a
glimpse of that great seaman himself, and of George, afterwards
the unworthy King of England; if, above all, you would see my
famous uncle, Sir Charles Tregellis, the King of the Bucks, and
the great fighting men whose names are still household words
amongst you, then give me your hand and let us start.</p>
<p>But I must warn you also that, if you think you will find much
that is of interest in your guide, you are destined to
disappointment.&nbsp; When I look over my bookshelves, I can see
that it is only the wise and witty and valiant who have ventured
to write down their experiences.&nbsp; For my own part, if I were
only assured that I was as clever and brave as the average man
about me, I should be well satisfied.&nbsp; Men of their hands
have thought well of my brains, and men of brains of my hands,
and that is the best that I can say of myself.&nbsp; Save in the
one matter of having an inborn readiness for music, so that the
mastery of any instrument comes very easily and naturally to me,
I cannot recall any single advantage which I can boast over my
fellows.&nbsp; In all things I have been a half-way man, for I am
of middle height, my eyes are neither blue nor grey, and my hair,
before Nature dusted it with her powder, was betwixt flaxen and
brown.&nbsp; I may, perhaps, claim this: that through life I have
never felt a touch of jealousy as I have admired a better man
than myself, and that I have always seen all things as they are,
myself included, which should count in my favour now that I sit
down in my mature age to write my memories.&nbsp; With your
permission, then, we will push my own personality as far as
possible out of the picture.&nbsp; If you can conceive me as a
thin and colourless cord upon which my would-be pearls are
strung, you will be accepting me upon the terms which I should
wish.</p>
<p>Our family, the Stones, have for many generations belonged to
the navy, and it has been a custom among us for the eldest son to
take the name of his father&rsquo;s favourite commander.&nbsp;
Thus we can trace our lineage back to old Vernon Stone, who
commanded a high-sterned, peak-nosed, fifty-gun ship against the
Dutch.&nbsp; Through Hawke Stone and Benbow Stone we came down to
my father, Anson Stone, who in his turn christened me Rodney, at
the parish church of St. Thomas at Portsmouth in the year of
grace 1786.</p>
<p>Out of my window as I write I can see my own great lad in the
garden, and if I were to call out &ldquo;Nelson!&rdquo; you would
see that I have been true to the traditions of our family.</p>
<p>My dear mother, the best that ever a man had, was the second
daughter of the Reverend John Tregellis, Vicar of Milton, which
is a small parish upon the borders of the marshes of
Langstone.&nbsp; She came of a poor family, but one of some
position, for her elder brother was the famous Sir Charles
Tregellis, who, having inherited the money of a wealthy East
Indian merchant, became in time the talk of the town and the very
particular friend of the Prince of Wales.&nbsp; Of him I shall
have more to say hereafter; but you will note now that he was my
own uncle, and brother to my mother.</p>
<p>I can remember her all through her beautiful life for she was
but a girl when she married, and little more when I can first
recall her busy fingers and her gentle voice.&nbsp; I see her as
a lovely woman with kind, dove&rsquo;s eyes, somewhat short of
stature it is true, but carrying herself very bravely.&nbsp; In
my memories of those days she is clad always in some purple
shimmering stuff, with a white kerchief round her long white
neck, and I see her fingers turning and darting as she works at
her knitting.&nbsp; I see her again in her middle years, sweet
and loving, planning, contriving, achieving, with the few
shillings a day of a lieutenant&rsquo;s pay on which to support
the cottage at Friar&rsquo;s Oak, and to keep a fair face to the
world.&nbsp; And now, if I do but step into the parlour, I can
see her once more, with over eighty years of saintly life behind
her, silver-haired, placid-faced, with her dainty ribboned cap,
her gold-rimmed glasses, and her woolly shawl with the blue
border.&nbsp; I loved her young and I love her old, and when she
goes she will take something with her which nothing in the world
can ever make good to me again.&nbsp; You may have many friends,
you who read this, and you may chance to marry more than once,
but your mother is your first and your last.&nbsp; Cherish her,
then, whilst you may, for the day will come when every hasty deed
or heedless word will come back with its sting to hive in your
own heart.</p>
<p>Such, then, was my mother; and as to my father, I can describe
him best when I come to the time when he returned to us from the
Mediterranean.&nbsp; During all my childhood he was only a name
to me, and a face in a miniature hung round my mother&rsquo;s
neck.&nbsp; At first they told me he was fighting the French, and
then after some years one heard less about the French and more
about General Buonaparte.&nbsp; I remember the awe with which one
day in Thomas Street, Portsmouth, I saw a print of the great
Corsican in a bookseller&rsquo;s window.&nbsp; This, then, was
the arch enemy with whom my father spent his life in terrible and
ceaseless contest.&nbsp; To my childish imagination it was a
personal affair, and I for ever saw my father and this
clean-shaven, thin-lipped man swaying and reeling in a deadly,
year-long grapple.&nbsp; It was not until I went to the Grammar
School that I understood how many other little boys there were
whose fathers were in the same case.</p>
<p>Only once in those long years did my father return home, which
will show you what it meant to be the wife of a sailor in those
days.&nbsp; It was just after we had moved from Portsmouth to
Friar&rsquo;s Oak, whither he came for a week before he set sail
with Admiral Jervis to help him to turn his name into Lord St.
Vincent.&nbsp; I remember that he frightened as well as
fascinated me with his talk of battles, and I can recall as if it
were yesterday the horror with which I gazed upon a spot of blood
upon his shirt ruffle, which had come, as I have no doubt, from a
mischance in shaving.&nbsp; At the time I never questioned that
it had spurted from some stricken Frenchman or Spaniard, and I
shrank from him in terror when he laid his horny hand upon my
head.&nbsp; My mother wept bitterly when he was gone, but for my
own part I was not sorry to see his blue back and white shorts
going down the garden walk, for I felt, with the heedless
selfishness of a child, that we were closer together, she and I,
when we were alone.</p>
<p>I was in my eleventh year when we moved from Portsmouth to
Friar&rsquo;s Oak, a little Sussex village to the north of
Brighton, which was recommended to us by my uncle, Sir Charles
Tregellis, one of whose grand friends, Lord Avon, had had his
seat near there.&nbsp; The reason of our moving was that living
was cheaper in the country, and that it was easier for my mother
to keep up the appearance of a gentlewoman when away from the
circle of those to whom she could not refuse hospitality.&nbsp;
They were trying times those to all save the farmers, who made
such profits that they could, as I have heard, afford to let half
their land lie fallow, while living like gentlemen upon the
rest.&nbsp; Wheat was at a hundred and ten shillings a quarter,
and the quartern loaf at one and ninepence.&nbsp; Even in the
quiet of the cottage of Friar&rsquo;s Oak we could scarce have
lived, were it not that in the blockading squadron in which my
father was stationed there was the occasional chance of a little
prize-money.&nbsp; The line-of-battle ships themselves, tacking
on and off outside Brest, could earn nothing save honour; but the
frigates in attendance made prizes of many coasters, and these,
as is the rule of the service, were counted as belonging to the
fleet, and their produce divided into head-money.&nbsp; In this
manner my father was able to send home enough to keep the cottage
and to pay for me at the day school of Mr. Joshua Allen, where
for four years I learned all that he had to teach.&nbsp; It was
at Allen&rsquo;s school that I first knew Jim Harrison, Boy Jim
as he has always been called, the nephew of Champion Harrison of
the village smithy.&nbsp; I can see him as he was in those days
with great, floundering, half-formed limbs like a Newfoundland
puppy, and a face that set every woman&rsquo;s head round as he
passed her.&nbsp; It was in those days that we began our lifelong
friendship, a friendship which still in our waning years binds us
closely as two brothers.&nbsp; I taught him his exercises, for he
never loved the sight of a book, and he in turn made me box and
wrestle, tickle trout on the Adur, and snare rabbits on Ditching
Down, for his hands were as active as his brain was slow.&nbsp;
He was two years my elder, however, so that, long before I had
finished my schooling, he had gone to help his uncle at the
smithy.</p>
<p>Friar&rsquo;s Oak is in a dip of the Downs, and the
forty-third milestone between London and Brighton lies on the
skirt of the village.&nbsp; It is but a small place, with an
ivied church, a fine vicarage, and a row of red-brick cottages
each in its own little garden.&nbsp; At one end was the forge of
Champion Harrison, with his house behind it, and at the other was
Mr. Allen&rsquo;s school.&nbsp; The yellow cottage, standing back
a little from the road, with its upper story bulging forward and
a crisscross of black woodwork let into the plaster, is the one
in which we lived.&nbsp; I do not know if it is still standing,
but I should think it likely, for it was not a place much given
to change.</p>
<p>Just opposite to us, at the other side of the broad, white
road, was the Friar&rsquo;s Oak Inn, which was kept in my day by
John Cummings, a man of excellent repute at home, but liable to
strange outbreaks when he travelled, as will afterwards become
apparent.&nbsp; Though there was a stream of traffic upon the
road, the coaches from Brighton were too fresh to stop, and those
from London too eager to reach their journey&rsquo;s end, so that
if it had not been for an occasional broken trace or loosened
wheel, the landlord would have had only the thirsty throats of
the village to trust to.&nbsp; Those were the days when the
Prince of Wales had just built his singular palace by the sea,
and so from May to September, which was the Brighton season,
there was never a day that from one to two hundred curricles,
chaises, and phaetons did not rattle past our doors.&nbsp; Many a
summer evening have Boy Jim and I lain upon the grass, watching
all these grand folk, and cheering the London coaches as they
came roaring through the dust clouds, leaders and wheelers
stretched to their work, the bugles screaming and the coachmen
with their low-crowned, curly-brimmed hats, and their faces as
scarlet as their coats.&nbsp; The passengers used to laugh when
Boy Jim shouted at them, but if they could have read his big,
half-set limbs and his loose shoulders aright, they would have
looked a little harder at him, perhaps, and given him back his
cheer.</p>
<p>Boy Jim had never known a father or a mother, and his whole
life had been spent with his uncle, Champion Harrison.&nbsp;
Harrison was the Friar&rsquo;s Oak blacksmith, and he had his
nickname because he fought Tom Johnson when he held the English
belt, and would most certainly have beaten him had the
Bedfordshire magistrates not appeared to break up the
fight.&nbsp; For years there was no such glutton to take
punishment and no more finishing hitter than Harrison, though he
was always, as I understand, a slow one upon his feet.&nbsp; At
last, in a fight with Black Baruk the Jew, he finished the battle
with such a lashing hit that he not only knocked his opponent
over the inner ropes, but he left him betwixt life and death for
long three weeks.&nbsp; During all this time Harrison lived half
demented, expecting every hour to feel the hand of a Bow Street
runner upon his collar, and to be tried for his life.&nbsp; This
experience, with the prayers of his wife, made him forswear the
ring for ever, and carry his great muscles into the one trade in
which they seemed to give him an advantage.&nbsp; There was a
good business to be done at Friar&rsquo;s Oak from the passing
traffic and the Sussex farmers, so that he soon became the
richest of the villagers; and he came to church on a Sunday with
his wife and his nephew, looking as respectable a family man as
one would wish to see.</p>
<p>He was not a tall man, not more than five feet seven inches,
and it was often said that if he had had an extra inch of reach
he would have been a match for Jackson or Belcher at their
best.&nbsp; His chest was like a barrel, and his forearms were
the most powerful that I have ever seen, with deep groves between
the smooth-swelling muscles like a piece of water-worn
rock.&nbsp; In spite of his strength, however, he was of a slow,
orderly, and kindly disposition, so that there was no man more
beloved over the whole country side.&nbsp; His heavy, placid,
clean-shaven face could set very sternly, as I have seen upon
occasion; but for me and every child in the village there was
ever a smile upon his lips and a greeting in his eyes.&nbsp;
There was not a beggar upon the country side who did not know
that his heart was as soft as his muscles were hard.</p>
<p>There was nothing that he liked to talk of more than his old
battles, but he would stop if he saw his little wife coming, for
the one great shadow in her life was the ever-present fear that
some day he would throw down sledge and rasp and be off to the
ring once more.&nbsp; And you must be reminded here once for all
that that former calling of his was by no means at that time in
the debased condition to which it afterwards fell.&nbsp; Public
opinion has gradually become opposed to it, for the reason that
it came largely into the hands of rogues, and because it fostered
ringside ruffianism.&nbsp; Even the honest and brave pugilist was
found to draw villainy round him, just as the pure and noble
racehorse does.&nbsp; For this reason the Ring is dying in
England, and we may hope that when Caunt and Bendigo have passed
away, they may have none to succeed them.&nbsp; But it was
different in the days of which I speak.&nbsp; Public opinion was
then largely in its favour, and there were good reasons why it
should be so.&nbsp; It was a time of war, when England with an
army and navy composed only of those who volunteered to fight
because they had fighting blood in them, had to encounter, as
they would now have to encounter, a power which could by despotic
law turn every citizen into a soldier.&nbsp; If the people had
not been full of this lust for combat, it is certain that England
must have been overborne.&nbsp; And it was thought, and is, on
the face of it, reasonable, that a struggle between two
indomitable men, with thirty thousand to view it and three
million to discuss it, did help to set a standard of hardihood
and endurance.&nbsp; Brutal it was, no doubt, and its brutality
is the end of it; but it is not so brutal as war, which will
survive it.&nbsp; Whether it is logical now to teach the people
to be peaceful in an age when their very existence may come to
depend upon their being warlike, is a question for wiser heads
than mine.&nbsp; But that was what we thought of it in the days
of your grandfathers, and that is why you might find statesmen
and philanthropists like Windham, Fox, and Althorp at the side of
the Ring.</p>
<p>The mere fact that solid men should patronize it was enough in
itself to prevent the villainy which afterwards crept in.&nbsp;
For over twenty years, in the days of Jackson, Brain, Cribb, the
Belchers, Pearce, Gully, and the rest, the leaders of the Ring
were men whose honesty was above suspicion; and those were just
the twenty years when the Ring may, as I have said, have served a
national purpose.&nbsp; You have heard how Pearce saved the
Bristol girl from the burning house, how Jackson won the respect
and friendship of the best men of his age, and how Gully rose to
a seat in the first Reformed Parliament.&nbsp; These were the men
who set the standard, and their trade carried with it this
obvious recommendation, that it is one in which no drunken or
foul-living man could long succeed.&nbsp; There were exceptions
among them, no doubt&mdash;bullies like Hickman and brutes like
Berks; in the main, I say again that they were honest men, brave
and enduring to an incredible degree, and a credit to the country
which produced them.&nbsp; It was, as you will see, my fate to
see something of them, and I speak of what I know.</p>
<p>In our own village, I can assure you that we were very proud
of the presence of such a man as Champion Harrison, and if folks
stayed at the inn, they would walk down as far as the smithy just
to have the sight of him.&nbsp; And he was worth seeing, too,
especially on a winter&rsquo;s night when the red glare of the
forge would beat upon his great muscles and upon the proud,
hawk-face of Boy Jim as they heaved and swayed over some glowing
plough coulter, framing themselves in sparks with every
blow.&nbsp; He would strike once with his thirty-pound swing
sledge, and Jim twice with his hand hammer; and the
&ldquo;Clunk&mdash;clink, clink! clunk&mdash;clink, clink!&rdquo;
would bring me flying down the village street, on the chance
that, since they were both at the anvil, there might be a place
for me at the bellows.</p>
<p>Only once during those village years can I remember Champion
Harrison showing me for an instant the sort of man that he had
been.&nbsp; It chanced one summer morning, when Boy Jim and I
were standing by the smithy door, that there came a private coach
from Brighton, with its four fresh horses, and its brass-work
shining, flying along with such a merry rattle and jingling, that
the Champion came running out with a hall-fullered shoe in his
tongs to have a look at it.&nbsp; A gentleman in a white
coachman&rsquo;s cape&mdash;a Corinthian, as we would call him in
those days&mdash;was driving, and half a dozen of his fellows,
laughing and shouting, were on the top behind him.&nbsp; It may
have been that the bulk of the smith caught his eye, and that he
acted in pure wantonness, or it may possibly have been an
accident, but, as he swung past, the twenty-foot thong of the
driver&rsquo;s whip hissed round, and we heard the sharp snap of
it across Harrison&rsquo;s leather apron.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa, master!&rdquo; shouted the smith, looking after
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not to be trusted on the box until
you can handle your whip better&rsquo;n that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried the driver, pulling up
his team.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bid you have a care, master, or there will be some
one-eyed folk along the road you drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you say that, do you?&rdquo; said the driver,
putting his whip into its socket and pulling off his
driving-gloves.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have a little talk with
you, my fine fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sporting gentlemen of those days were very fine boxers for
the most part, for it was the mode to take a course of Mendoza,
just as a few years afterwards there was no man about town who
had not had the mufflers on with Jackson.&nbsp; Knowing their own
prowess, they never refused the chance of a wayside adventure,
and it was seldom indeed that the bargee or the navigator had
much to boast of after a young blood had taken off his coat to
him.</p>
<p>This one swung himself off the box-seat with the alacrity of a
man who has no doubts about the upshot of the quarrel, and after
hanging his caped coat upon the swingle-bar, he daintily turned
up the ruffled cuffs of his white cambric shirt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll pay you for your advice, my man,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>I am sure that the men upon the coach knew who the burly smith
was, and looked upon it as a prime joke to see their companion
walk into such a trap.&nbsp; They roared with delight, and
bellowed out scraps of advice to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knock some of the soot off him, Lord Frederick!&rdquo;
they shouted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Give the Johnny Raw his
breakfast.&nbsp; Chuck him in among his own cinders!&nbsp;
Sharp&rsquo;s the word, or you&rsquo;ll see the back of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Encouraged by these cries, the young aristocrat advanced upon
his man.&nbsp; The smith never moved, but his mouth set grim and
hard, while his tufted brows came down over his keen, grey
eyes.&nbsp; The tongs had fallen, and his hands were hanging
free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a care, master,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get pepper if you don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something in the assured voice, and something also in the
quiet pose, warned the young lord of his danger.&nbsp; I saw him
look hard at his antagonist, and as he did so, his hands and his
jaw dropped together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Gad!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s Jack
Harrison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name, master!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I thought you were some Essex chaw-bacon!&nbsp;
Why, man, I haven&rsquo;t seen you since the day you nearly
killed Black Baruk, and cost me a cool hundred by doing
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How they roared on the coach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Smoked!&nbsp; Smoked, by Gad!&rdquo; they yelled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Jack Harrison the bruiser!&nbsp; Lord Frederick
was going to take on the ex-champion.&nbsp; Give him one on the
apron, Fred, and see what happens.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the driver had already climbed back into his perch,
laughing as loudly as any of his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll let you off this time, Harrison,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are those your sons down there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my nephew, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a guinea for him!&nbsp; He shall never say
I robbed him of his uncle.&rdquo;&nbsp; And so, having turned the
laugh in his favour by his merry way of taking it, he cracked his
whip, and away they flew to make London under the five hours;
while Jack Harrison, with his half-fullered shoe in his hand,
went whistling back to the forge.</p>

18</span>CHAPTER II.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE WALKER OF CLIFFE ROYAL.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span> much for Champion
Harrison!&nbsp; Now, I wish to say something more about Boy Jim,
not only because he was the comrade of my youth, but because you
will find as you go on that this book is his story rather than
mine, and that there came a time when his name and his fame were
in the mouths of all England.&nbsp; You will bear with me,
therefore, while I tell you of his character as it was in those
days, and especially of one very singular adventure which neither
of us are likely to forget.</p>
<p>It was strange to see Jim with his uncle and his aunt, for he
seemed to be of another race and breed to them.&nbsp; Often I
have watched them come up the aisle upon a Sunday, first the
square, thick-set man, and then the little, worn, anxious-eyed
woman, and last this glorious lad with his clear-cut face, his
black curls, and his step so springy and light that it seemed as
if he were bound to earth by some lesser tie than the
heavy-footed villagers round him.&nbsp; He had not yet attained
his full six foot of stature, but no judge of a man (and every
woman, at least, is one) could look at his perfect shoulders, his
narrow loins, and his proud head that sat upon his neck like an
eagle upon its perch, without feeling that sober joy which all
that is beautiful in Nature gives to us&mdash;a vague
self-content, as though in some way we also had a hand in the
making of it.</p>
<p>But we are used to associate beauty with softness in a
man.&nbsp; I do not know why they should be so coupled, and they
never were with Jim.&nbsp; Of all men that I have known, he was
the most iron-hard in body and in mind.&nbsp; Who was there among
us who could walk with him, or run with him, or swim with
him?&nbsp; Who on all the country side, save only Boy Jim, would
have swung himself over Wolstonbury Cliff, and clambered down a
hundred feet with the mother hawk flapping at his ears in the
vain struggle to hold him from her nest?&nbsp; He was but
sixteen, with his gristle not yet all set into bone, when he
fought and beat Gipsy Lee, of Burgess Hill, who called himself
the &ldquo;Cock of the South Downs.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was after
this that Champion Harrison took his training as a boxer in
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather you left millin&rsquo; alone, Boy
Jim,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and so had the missus; but if mill
you must, it will not be my fault if you cannot hold up your
hands to anything in the south country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was not long before he made good his promise.</p>
<p>I have said already that Boy Jim had no love for his books,
but by that I meant school-books, for when it came to the reading
of romances or of anything which had a touch of gallantry or
adventure, there was no tearing him away from it until it was
finished.&nbsp; When such a book came into his hands,
Friar&rsquo;s Oak and the smithy became a dream to him, and his
life was spent out upon the ocean or wandering over the broad
continents with his heroes.&nbsp; And he would draw me into his
enthusiasms also, so that I was glad to play Friday to his Crusoe
when he proclaimed that the Clump at Clayton was a desert island,
and that we were cast upon it for a week.&nbsp; But when I found
that we were actually to sleep out there without covering every
night, and that he proposed that our food should be the sheep of
the Downs (wild goats he called them) cooked upon a fire, which
was to be made by the rubbing together of two sticks, my heart
failed me, and on the very first night I crept away to my
mother.&nbsp; But Jim stayed out there for the whole weary
week&mdash;a wet week it was, too!&mdash;and came back at the end
of it looking a deal wilder and dirtier than his hero does in the
picture-books.&nbsp; It is well that he had only promised to stay
a week, for, if it had been a month, he would have died of cold
and hunger before his pride would have let him come home.</p>
<p>His pride!&mdash;that was the deepest thing in all Jim&rsquo;s
nature.&nbsp; It is a mixed quality to my mind, half a virtue and
half a vice: a virtue in holding a man out of the dirt; a vice in
making it hard for him to rise when once he has fallen.&nbsp; Jim
was proud down to the very marrow of his bones.&nbsp; You
remember the guinea that the young lord had thrown him from the
box of the coach?&nbsp; Two days later somebody picked it from
the roadside mud.&nbsp; Jim only had seen where it had fallen,
and he would not deign even to point it out to a beggar.&nbsp;
Nor would he stoop to give a reason in such a case, but would
answer all remonstrances with a curl of his lip and a flash of
his dark eyes.&nbsp; Even at school he was the same, with such a
sense of his own dignity, that other folk had to think of it
too.&nbsp; He might say, as he did say, that a right angle was a
proper sort of angle, or put Panama in Sicily, but old Joshua
Allen would as soon have thought of raising his cane against him
as he would of letting me off if I had said as much.&nbsp; And so
it was that, although Jim was the son of nobody, and I of a
King&rsquo;s officer, it always seemed to me to have been a
condescension on his part that he should have chosen me as his
friend.</p>
<p>It was this pride of Boy Jim&rsquo;s which led to an adventure
which makes me shiver now when I think of it.</p>
<p>It happened in the August of &rsquo;99, or it may have been in
the early days of September; but I remember that we heard the
cuckoo in Patcham Wood, and that Jim said that perhaps it was the
last of him.&nbsp; I was still at school, but Jim had left, he
being nigh sixteen and I thirteen.&nbsp; It was my Saturday
half-holiday, and we spent it, as we often did, out upon the
Downs.&nbsp; Our favourite place was beyond Wolstonbury, where we
could stretch ourselves upon the soft, springy, chalk grass among
the plump little Southdown sheep, chatting with the shepherds, as
they leaned upon their queer old Pyecombe crooks, made in the
days when Sussex turned out more iron than all the counties of
England.</p>
<p>It was there that we lay upon that glorious afternoon.&nbsp;
If we chose to roll upon our right sides, the whole weald lay in
front of us, with the North Downs curving away in olive-green
folds, with here and there the snow-white rift of a chalk-pit; if
we turned upon our left, we overlooked the huge blue stretch of
the Channel.&nbsp; A convoy, as I can well remember, was coming
up it that day, the timid flock of merchantmen in front; the
frigates, like well-trained dogs, upon the skirts; and two burly
drover line-of-battle ships rolling along behind them.&nbsp; My
fancy was soaring out to my father upon the waters, when a word
from Jim brought it back on to the grass like a broken-winged
gull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roddy,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;have you heard that
Cliffe Royal is haunted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had I heard it?&nbsp; Of course I had heard it.&nbsp; Who was
there in all the Down country who had not heard of the Walker of
Cliffe Royal?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know the story of it, Roddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said I, with some pride, &ldquo;I ought to
know it, seeing that my mother&rsquo;s brother, Sir Charles
Tregellis, was the nearest friend of Lord Avon, and was at this
card-party when the thing happened.&nbsp; I heard the vicar and
my mother talking about it last week, and it was all so clear to
me that I might have been there when the murder was
done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a strange story,&rdquo; said Jim, thoughtfully;
&ldquo;but when I asked my aunt about it, she would give me no
answer; and as to my uncle, he cut me short at the very mention
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a good reason for that,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;for Lord Avon was, as I have heard, your uncle&rsquo;s
best friend; and it is but natural that he would not wish to
speak of his disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me the story, Roddy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is an old one now&mdash;fourteen years old&mdash;and
yet they have not got to the end of it.&nbsp; There were four of
them who had come down from London to spend a few days in Lord
Avon&rsquo;s old house.&nbsp; One was his own young brother,
Captain Barrington; another was his cousin, Sir Lothian Hume; Sir
Charles Tregellis, my uncle, was the third; and Lord Avon the
fourth.&nbsp; They are fond of playing cards for money, these
great people, and they played and played for two days and a
night.&nbsp; Lord Avon lost, and Sir Lothian lost, and my uncle
lost, and Captain Barrington won until he could win no
more.&nbsp; He won their money, but above all he won papers from
his elder brother which meant a great deal to him.&nbsp; It was
late on a Monday night that they stopped playing.&nbsp; On the
Tuesday morning Captain Barrington was found dead beside his bed
with his throat cut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Lord Avon did it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His papers were found burned in the grate, his
wristband was clutched in the dead man&rsquo;s hand, and his
knife lay beside the body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did they hang him, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were too slow in laying hands upon him.&nbsp; He
waited until he saw that they had brought it home to him, and
then he fled.&nbsp; He has never been seen since, but it is said
that he reached America.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the ghost walks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many who have seen it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is the house still empty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it is in the keeping of the law.&nbsp; Lord
Avon had no children, and Sir Lothian Hume&mdash;the same who was
at the card-party&mdash;is his nephew and heir.&nbsp; But he can
touch nothing until he can prove Lord Avon to be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim lay silent for a bit, plucking at the short grass with his
fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roddy,&rdquo; said he at last, &ldquo;will you come
with me to-night and look for the ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turned me cold, the very thought of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother would not let me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slip out when she&rsquo;s abed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll wait
for you at the smithy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cliffe Royal is locked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll open a window easy enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not afraid if you are with me, Roddy.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll promise you that no ghost shall hurt you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I gave him my word that I would come, and then all the rest
of the day I went about the most sad-faced lad in Sussex.&nbsp;
It was all very well for Boy Jim!&nbsp; It was that pride of his
which was taking him there.&nbsp; He would go because there was
no one else on the country side that would dare.&nbsp; But I had
no pride of that sort.&nbsp; I was quite of the same way of
thinking as the others, and would as soon have thought of passing
my night at Jacob&rsquo;s gibbet on Ditchling Common as in the
haunted house of Cliffe Royal.&nbsp; Still, I could not bring
myself to desert Jim; and so, as I say, I slunk about the house
with so pale and peaky a face that my dear mother would have it
that I had been at the green apples, and sent me to bed early
with a dish of camomile tea for my supper.</p>
<p>England went to rest betimes in those days, for there were few
who could afford the price of candles.&nbsp; When I looked out of
my window just after the clock had gone ten, there was not a
light in the village save only at the inn.&nbsp; It was but a few
feet from the ground, so I slipped out, and there was Jim waiting
for me at the smithy corner.&nbsp; We crossed John&rsquo;s Common
together, and so past Ridden&rsquo;s Farm, meeting only one or
two riding officers upon the way.&nbsp; There was a brisk wind
blowing, and the moon kept peeping through the rifts of the scud,
so that our road was sometimes silver-clear, and sometimes so
black that we found ourselves among the brambles and gorse-bushes
which lined it.&nbsp; We came at last to the wooden gate with the
high stone pillars by the roadside, and, looking through between
the rails, we saw the long avenue of oaks, and at the end of this
ill-boding tunnel, the pale face of the house glimmered in the
moonshine.</p>
<p>That would have been enough for me, that one glimpse of it,
and the sound of the night wind sighing and groaning among the
branches.&nbsp; But Jim swung the gate open, and up we went, the
gravel squeaking beneath our tread.&nbsp; It towered high, the
old house, with many little windows in which the moon glinted,
and with a strip of water running round three sides of it.&nbsp;
The arched door stood right in the face of us, and on one side a
lattice hung open upon its hinges.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re in luck, Roddy,&rdquo; whispered Jim.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s one of the windows open.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think we&rsquo;ve gone far enough,
Jim?&rdquo; said I, with my teeth chattering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lift you in first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, I&rsquo;ll not go first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I will.&rdquo;&nbsp; He gripped the sill, and had
his knee on it in an instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, Roddy, give me
your hands.&rdquo;&nbsp; With a pull he had me up beside him, and
a moment later we were both in the haunted house.</p>
<p>How hollow it sounded when we jumped down on to the wooden
floor!&nbsp; There was such a sudden boom and reverberation that
we both stood silent for a moment.&nbsp; Then Jim burst out
laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an old drum of a place it is!&rdquo; he cried;
&ldquo;we&rsquo;ll strike a light, Roddy, and see where we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had brought a candle and a tinder-box in his pocket.&nbsp;
When the flame burned up, we saw an arched stone roof above our
heads, and broad deal shelves all round us covered with dusty
dishes.&nbsp; It was the pantry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll show you round,&rdquo; said Jim, merrily;
and, pushing the door open, he led the way into the hall.&nbsp; I
remember the high, oak-panelled walls, with the heads of deer
jutting out, and a single white bust, which sent my heart into my
mouth, in the corner.&nbsp; Many rooms opened out of this, and we
wandered from one to the other&mdash;the kitchens, the
still-room, the morning-room, the dining-room, all filled with
the same choking smell of dust and of mildew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is where they played the cards, Jim,&rdquo; said
I, in a hushed voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was on that very
table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, here are the cards themselves!&rdquo; cried he;
and he pulled a brown towel from something in the centre of the
sideboard.&nbsp; Sure enough it was a pile of
playing-cards&mdash;forty packs, I should think, at the
least&mdash;which had lain there ever since that tragic game
which was played before I was born.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wonder whence that stair leads?&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go up there, Jim!&rdquo; I cried, clutching
at his arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;That must lead to the room of the
murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vicar said that they saw on the ceiling&mdash;Oh,
Jim, you can see it even now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held up his candle, and there was a great, dark smudge upon
the white plaster above us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;but anyhow I&rsquo;m going to have a look at
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Jim, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, Roddy! you can stay here if you are afraid.&nbsp;
I won&rsquo;t be more than a minute.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no use
going on a ghost hunt unless&mdash;Great Lord, there&rsquo;s
something coming down the stairs!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard it too&mdash;a shuffling footstep in the room above,
and then a creak from the steps, and then another creak, and
another.&nbsp; I saw Jim&rsquo;s face as if it had been carved
out of ivory, with his parted lips and his staring eyes fixed
upon the black square of the stair opening.&nbsp; He still held
the light, but his fingers twitched, and with every twitch the
shadows sprang from the walls to the ceiling.&nbsp; As to myself,
my knees gave way under me, and I found myself on the floor
crouching down behind Jim, with a scream frozen in my
throat.&nbsp; And still the step came slowly from stair to
stair.</p>
<p>Then, hardly daring to look and yet unable to turn away my
eyes, I saw a figure dimly outlined in the corner upon which the
stair opened.&nbsp; There was a silence in which I could hear my
poor heart thumping, and then when I looked again the figure was
gone, and the low creak, creak was heard once more upon the
stairs.&nbsp; Jim sprang after it, and I was left half-fainting
in the moonlight.</p>
<p>But it was not for long.&nbsp; He was down again in a minute,
and, passing his hand under my arm, he half led and half carried
me out of the house.&nbsp; It was not until we were in the fresh
night air again that he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you stand, Roddy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but I&rsquo;m shaking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I,&rdquo; said he, passing his hand over his
forehead.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ask your pardon, Roddy.&nbsp; I was a
fool to bring you on such an errand.&nbsp; But I never believed
in such things.&nbsp; I know better now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could it have been a man, Jim?&rdquo; I asked, plucking
up my courage now that I could hear the dogs barking on the
farms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a spirit, Rodney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I followed it and saw it vanish into a wall, as
easily as an eel into sand.&nbsp; Why, Roddy, what&rsquo;s amiss
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My fears were all back upon me, and every nerve creeping with
horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me away, Jim!&nbsp; Take me away!&rdquo; I
cried.</p>
<p>I was glaring down the avenue, and his eyes followed
mine.&nbsp; Amid the gloom of the oak trees something was coming
towards us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet, Roddy!&rdquo; whispered Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;By
heavens, come what may, my arms are going round it this
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We crouched as motionless as the trunks behind us.&nbsp; Heavy
steps ploughed their way through the soft gravel, and a broad
figure loomed upon us in the darkness.</p>
<p>Jim sprang upon it like a tiger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>You&rsquo;re</i> not a spirit, anyway!&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>The man gave a shout of surprise, and then a growl of
rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce!&rdquo; he roared, and then,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll break your neck if you don&rsquo;t let
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The threat might not have loosened Jim&rsquo;s grip, but the
voice did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, uncle!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;m blessed if it isn&rsquo;t Boy
Jim!&nbsp; And what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; Why, it&rsquo;s young
Master Rodney Stone, as I&rsquo;m a living sinner!&nbsp; What in
the world are you two doing up at Cliffe Royal at this time of
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had all moved out into the moonlight, and there was
Champion Harrison with a big bundle on his arm,&mdash;and such a
look of amazement upon his face as would have brought a smile
back on to mine had my heart not still been cramped with
fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re exploring,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exploring, are you?&nbsp; Well, I don&rsquo;t think you
were meant to be Captain Cooks, either of you, for I never saw
such a pair of peeled-turnip faces.&nbsp; Why, Jim, what are you
afraid of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid, uncle.&nbsp; I never was afraid;
but spirits are new to me, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Spirits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in Cliffe Royal, and we&rsquo;ve seen
the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Champion gave a whistle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the game, is it?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you have speech with it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It vanished first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Champion whistled once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard there is something of the sort up
yonder,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not a thing as I
would advise you to meddle with.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s enough
trouble with the folk of this world, Boy Jim, without going out
of your way to mix up with those of another.&nbsp; As to young
Master Rodney Stone, if his good mother saw that white face of
his, she&rsquo;d never let him come to the smithy more.&nbsp;
Walk slowly on, and I&rsquo;ll see you back to Friar&rsquo;s
Oak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had gone half a mile, perhaps, when the Champion overtook
us, and I could not but observe that the bundle was no longer
under his arm.&nbsp; We were nearly at the smithy before Jim
asked the question which was already in my mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What took <i>you</i> up to Cliffe Royal,
uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, as a man gets on in years,&rdquo; said the
Champion, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s many a duty turns up that the
likes of you have no idea of.&nbsp; When you&rsquo;re near forty
yourself, you&rsquo;ll maybe know the truth of what I
say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that was all we could draw from him; but, young as I was, I
had heard of coast smuggling and of packages carried to lonely
places at night, so that from that time on, if I had heard that
the preventives had made a capture, I was never easy until I saw
the jolly face of Champion Harrison looking out of his smithy
door.</p>

33</span>CHAPTER III.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PLAY-ACTRESS OF ANSTEY
CROSS.</span></h2>
<p>I <span class="smcap">have</span> told you something about
Friar&rsquo;s Oak, and about the life that we led there.&nbsp;
Now that my memory goes back to the old place it would gladly
linger, for every thread which I draw from the skein of the past
brings out half a dozen others that were entangled with it.&nbsp;
I was in two minds when I began whether I had enough in me to
make a book of, and now I know that I could write one about
Friar&rsquo;s Oak alone, and the folk whom I knew in my
childhood.&nbsp; They were hard and uncouth, some of them, I
doubt not; and yet, seen through the golden haze of time, they
all seem sweet and lovable.&nbsp; There was our good vicar, Mr.
Jefferson, who loved the whole world save only Mr. Slack, the
Baptist minister of Clayton; and there was kindly Mr. Slack, who
was all men&rsquo;s brother save only of Mr. Jefferson, the vicar
of Friar&rsquo;s Oak.&nbsp; Then there was Monsieur Rudin, the
French Royalist refugee who lived over on the Pangdean road, and
who, when the news of a victory came in, was convulsed with joy
because we had beaten Buonaparte, and shaken with rage because we
had beaten the French, so that after the Nile he wept for a whole
day out of delight and then for another one out of fury,
alternately clapping his hands and stamping his feet.&nbsp; Well
I remember his thin, upright figure and the way in which he
jauntily twirled his little cane; for cold and hunger could not
cast him down, though we knew that he had his share of
both.&nbsp; Yet he was so proud and had such a grand manner of
talking, that no one dared to offer him a cloak or a meal.&nbsp;
I can see his face now, with a flush over each craggy cheek-bone
when the butcher made him the present of some ribs of beef.&nbsp;
He could not but take it, and yet whilst he was stalking off he
threw a proud glance over his shoulder at the butcher, and he
said, &ldquo;Monsieur, I have a dog!&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet it was
Monsieur Rudin and not his dog who looked plumper for a week to
come.</p>
<p>Then I remember Mr. Paterson, the farmer, who was what you
would now call a Radical, though at that time some called him a
Priestley-ite, and some a Fox-ite, and nearly everybody a
traitor.&nbsp; It certainly seemed to me at the time to be very
wicked that a man should look glum when he heard of a British
victory; and when they burned his straw image at the gate of his
farm, Boy Jim and I were among those who lent a hand.&nbsp; But
we were bound to confess that he was game, though he might be a
traitor, for down he came, striding into the midst of us with his
brown coat and his buckled shoes, and the fire beating upon his
grim, schoolmaster face.&nbsp; My word, how he rated us, and how
glad we were at last to sneak quietly away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You livers of a lie!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
and those like you have been preaching peace for nigh two
thousand years, and cutting throats the whole time.&nbsp; If the
money that is lost in taking French lives were spent in saving
English ones, you would have more right to burn candles in your
windows.&nbsp; Who are you that dare to come here to insult a
law-abiding man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are the people of England!&rdquo; cried young Master
Ovington, the son of the Tory Squire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You! you horse-racing, cock-fighting
ne&rsquo;er-do-weel!&nbsp; Do you presume to talk for the people
of England?&nbsp; They are a deep, strong, silent stream, and you
are the scum, the bubbles, the poor, silly froth that floats upon
the surface.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We thought him very wicked then, but, looking back, I am not
sure that we were not very wicked ourselves.</p>
<p>And then there were the smugglers!&nbsp; The Downs swarmed
with them, for since there might be no lawful trade betwixt
France and England, it had all to run in that channel.&nbsp; I
have been up on St. John&rsquo;s Common upon a dark night, and,
lying among the bracken, I have seen as many as seventy mules and
a man at the head of each go flitting past me as silently as
trout in a stream.&nbsp; Not one of them but bore its two ankers
of the right French cognac, or its bale of silk of Lyons and lace
of Valenciennes.&nbsp; I knew Dan Scales, the head of them, and I
knew Tom Hislop, the riding officer, and I remember the night
they met.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you fight, Dan?&rdquo; asked Tom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Tom; thou must fight for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On which Tom drew his pistol, and blew Dan&rsquo;s brains
out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a sad thing to do,&rdquo; he said afterwards,
&ldquo;but I knew Dan was too good a man for me, for we tried it
out before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Tom who paid a poet from Brighton to write the lines
for the tombstone, which we all thought were very true and good,
beginning&mdash;</p>
<p class="poetry">&ldquo;Alas!&nbsp; Swift flew the fatal lead<br
/>
Which pierc&eacute;d through the young man&rsquo;s head.<br />
He instantly fell, resigned his breath,<br />
And closed his languid eyes in death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was more of it, and I dare say it is all still to be
read in Patcham Churchyard.</p>
<p>One day, about the time of our Cliffe Royal adventure, I was
seated in the cottage looking round at the curios which my father
had fastened on to the walls, and wishing, like the lazy lad that
I was, that Mr. Lilly had died before ever he wrote his Latin
grammar, when my mother, who was sitting knitting in the window,
gave a little cry of surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a
vulgar-looking woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was so rare to hear my mother say a hard word against
anybody (unless it were General Buonaparte) that I was across the
room and at the window in a jump.&nbsp; A pony-chaise was coming
slowly down the village street, and in it was the
queerest-looking person that I had ever seen.&nbsp; She was very
stout, with a face that was of so dark a red that it shaded away
into purple over the nose and cheeks.&nbsp; She wore a great hat
with a white curling ostrich feather, and from under its brim her
two bold, black eyes stared out with a look of anger and defiance
as if to tell the folk that she thought less of them than they
could do of her.&nbsp; She had some sort of scarlet pelisse with
white swans-down about her neck, and she held the reins slack in
her hands, while the pony wandered from side to side of the road
as the fancy took him.&nbsp; Each time the chaise swayed, her
head with the great hat swayed also, so that sometimes we saw the
crown of it and sometimes the brim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a dreadful sight!&rdquo; cried my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is amiss with her, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven forgive me if I misjudge her, Rodney, but I
think that the unfortunate woman has been drinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;she has pulled the chaise
up at the smithy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll find out all the news for
you;&rdquo; and, catching up my cap, away I scampered.</p>
<p>Champion Harrison had been shoeing a horse at the forge door,
and when I got into the street I could see him with the
creature&rsquo;s hoof still under his arm, and the rasp in his
hand, kneeling down amid the white parings.&nbsp; The woman was
beckoning him from the chaise, and he staring up at her with the
queerest expression upon his face.&nbsp; Presently he threw down
his rasp and went across to her, standing by the wheel and
shaking his head as he talked to her.&nbsp; For my part, I
slipped into the smithy, where Boy Jim was finishing the shoe,
and I watched the neatness of his work and the deft way in which
he turned up the caulkens.&nbsp; When he had done with it he
carried it out, and there was the strange woman still talking
with his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that he?&rdquo; I heard her ask.</p>
<p>Champion Harrison nodded.</p>
<p>She looked at Jim, and I never saw such eyes in a human head,
so large, and black, and wonderful.&nbsp; Boy as I was, I knew
that, in spite of that bloated face, this woman had once been
very beautiful.&nbsp; She put out a hand, with all the fingers
going as if she were playing on the harpsichord, and she touched
Jim on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope&mdash;I hope you&rsquo;re well,&rdquo; she
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said Jim, staring from
her to his uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And happy too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, ma&rsquo;am, I thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing that you crave for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, ma&rsquo;am, I have all that I
lack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will do, Jim,&rdquo; said his uncle, in a stern
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blow up the forge again, for that shoe wants
reheating.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it seemed as if the woman had something else that she
would say, for she was angry that he should be sent away.&nbsp;
Her eyes gleamed, and her head tossed, while the smith with his
two big hands outspread seemed to be soothing her as best he
could.&nbsp; For a long time they whispered until at last she
appeared to be satisfied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, then?&rdquo; she cried loud out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep your word and I&rsquo;ll keep mine,&rdquo;
said she, and dropped the lash on the pony&rsquo;s back.&nbsp;
The smith stood with the rasp in his hand, looking after her
until she was just a little red spot on the white road.&nbsp;
Then he turned, and I never saw his face so grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s Miss Hinton,
who has come to live at The Maples, out Anstey Cross way.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s taken a kind of a fancy to you, Jim, and maybe she
can help you on a bit.&nbsp; I promised her that you would go
over and see her to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want her help, uncle, and I don&rsquo;t
want to see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve promised, Jim, and you wouldn&rsquo;t
make me out a liar.&nbsp; She does but want to talk with you, for
it is a lonely life she leads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would she want to talk with such as me
about?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I cannot say that, but she seemed very set upon
it, and women have their fancies.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s young
Master Stone here who wouldn&rsquo;t refuse to go and see a good
lady, I&rsquo;ll warrant, if he thought he might better his
fortune by doing so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, uncle, I&rsquo;ll go if Roddy Stone will go with
me,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course he&rsquo;ll go.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you, Master
Rodney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it ended in my saying &ldquo;yes,&rdquo; and back I went
with all my news to my mother, who dearly loved a little bit of
gossip.&nbsp; She shook her head when she heard where I was
going, but she did not say nay, and so it was settled.</p>
<p>It was a good four miles of a walk, but when we reached it you
would not wish to see a more cosy little house: all honeysuckle
and creepers, with a wooden porch and lattice windows.&nbsp; A
common-looking woman opened the door for us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Hinton cannot see you,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But she asked us to come,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; cried the woman, in a
rude voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you that she can&rsquo;t see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stood irresolute for a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe you would just tell her I am here,&rdquo; said
Jim, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell her!&nbsp; How am I to tell her when she
couldn&rsquo;t so much as hear a pistol in her ears?&nbsp; Try
and tell her yourself, if you have a mind to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She threw open a door as she spoke, and there, in a reclining
chair at the further end of the room, we caught a glimpse of a
figure all lumped together, huge and shapeless, with tails of
black hair hanging down.</p>
<p>The sound of dreadful, swine-like breathing fell upon our
ears.&nbsp; It was but a glance, and then we were off hot-foot
for home.&nbsp; As for me, I was so young that I was not sure
whether this was funny or terrible; but when I looked at Jim to
see how he took it, he was looking quite white and ill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not tell any one, Roddy,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not unless it&rsquo;s my mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t even tell my uncle.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll say
she was ill, the poor lady! it&rsquo;s enough that we should have
seen her in her shame, without its being the gossip of the
village.&nbsp; It makes me feel sick and heavy at
heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was so yesterday, Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was she?&nbsp; I never marked it.&nbsp; But I know that
she has kind eyes and a kind heart, for I saw the one in the
other when she looked at me.&nbsp; Maybe it&rsquo;s the want of a
friend that has driven her to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It blighted his spirits for days, and when it had all gone
from my mind it was brought back to me by his manner.&nbsp; But
it was not to be our last memory of the lady with the scarlet
pelisse, for before the week was out Jim came round to ask me if
I would again go up with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My uncle has had a letter,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She would speak with me, and I would be easier if you came
with me, Rod.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For me it was only a pleasure outing, but I could see, as we
drew near the house, that Jim was troubling in his mind lest we
should find that things were amiss.</p>
<p>His fears were soon set at rest, however, for we had scarce
clicked the garden gate before the woman was out of the door of
the cottage and running down the path to meet us.&nbsp; She was
so strange a figure, with some sort of purple wrapper on, and her
big, flushed face smiling out of it, that I might, if I had been
alone, have taken to my heels at the sight of her.&nbsp; Even Jim
stopped for a moment as if he were not very sure of himself, but
her hearty ways soon set us at our ease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is indeed good of you to come and see an old, lonely
woman,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and I owe you an apology that I
should give you a fruitless journey on Tuesday, but in a sense
you were yourselves the cause of it, since the thought of your
coming had excited me, and any excitement throws me into a
nervous fever.&nbsp; My poor nerves!&nbsp; You can see for
yourselves how they serve me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She held out her twitching hands as she spoke.&nbsp; Then she
passed one of them through Jim&rsquo;s arm, and walked with him
up the path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must let me know you, and know you well,&rdquo;
said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your uncle and aunt are quite old
acquaintances of mine, and though you cannot remember me, I have
held you in my arms when you were an infant.&nbsp; Tell me,
little man,&rdquo; she added, turning to me, &ldquo;what do you
call your friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy Jim, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then if you will not think me forward, I will call you
Boy Jim also.&nbsp; We elderly people have our privileges, you
know.&nbsp; And now you shall come in with me, and we will take a
dish of tea together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She led the way into a cosy room&mdash;the same which we had
caught a glimpse of when last we came&mdash;and there, in the
middle, was a table with white napery, and shining glass, and
gleaming china, and red-cheeked apples piled upon a centre-dish,
and a great plateful of smoking muffins which the cross-faced
maid had just carried in.&nbsp; You can think that we did justice
to all the good things, and Miss Hinton would ever keep pressing
us to pass our cup and to fill our plate.&nbsp; Twice during our
meal she rose from her chair and withdrew into a cupboard at the
end of the room, and each time I saw Jim&rsquo;s face cloud, for
we heard a gentle clink of glass against glass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, little man,&rdquo; said she to me, when the
table had been cleared.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why are you looking round so
much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there are so many pretty things upon the
walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And which do you think the prettiest of
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that!&rdquo; said I, pointing to a picture which
hung opposite to me.&nbsp; It was of a tall and slender girl,
with the rosiest cheeks and the tenderest eyes&mdash;so daintily
dressed, too, that I had never seen anything more perfect.&nbsp;
She had a posy of flowers in her hand and another one was lying
upon the planks of wood upon which she was standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s the prettiest, is it?&rdquo; said she,
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, now, walk up to it, and let us hear
what is writ beneath it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did as she asked, and read out: &ldquo;Miss Polly Hinton, as
&lsquo;Peggy,&rsquo; in <i>The Country Wife</i>, played for her
benefit at the Haymarket Theatre, September 14th,
1782.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a play-actress,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you rude little boy, to say it in such a
tone,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;as if a play-actress wasn&rsquo;t
as good as any one else.&nbsp; Why, &rsquo;twas but the other day
that the Duke of Clarence, who may come to call himself King of
England, married Mrs. Jordan, who is herself only a
play-actress.&nbsp; And whom think you that this one
is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood under the picture with her arms folded across her
great body, and her big black eyes looking from one to the other
of us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, where are your eyes?&rdquo; she cried at
last.&nbsp; &ldquo;<i>I</i> was Miss Polly Hinton of the
Haymarket Theatre.&nbsp; And perhaps you never heard the name
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were compelled to confess that we never had.&nbsp; And the
very name of play-actress had filled us both with a kind of vague
horror, like the country-bred folk that we were.&nbsp; To us they
were a class apart, to be hinted at rather than named, with the
wrath of the Almighty hanging over them like a
thundercloud.&nbsp; Indeed, His judgments seemed to be in visible
operation before us when we looked upon what this woman was, and
what she had been.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, laughing like one who is hurt,
&ldquo;you have no cause to say anything, for I read on your face
what you have been taught to think of me.&nbsp; So this is the
upbringing that you have had, Jim&mdash;to think evil of that
which you do not understand!&nbsp; I wish you had been in the
theatre that very night with Prince Florizel and four Dukes in
the boxes, and all the wits and macaronis of London rising at me
in the pit.&nbsp; If Lord Avon had not given me a cast in his
carriage, I had never got my flowers back to my lodgings in York
Street, Westminster.&nbsp; And now two little country lads are
sitting in judgment upon me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s pride brought a flush on to his cheeks, for he did
not like to be called a country lad, or to have it supposed that
he was so far behind the grand folk in London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never been inside a play-house,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;I know nothing of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I am not in voice, and it
is ill to play in a little room with but two to listen, but you
must conceive me to be the Queen of the Peruvians, who is
exhorting her countrymen to rise up against the Spaniards, who
are oppressing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And straightway that coarse, swollen woman became a
queen&mdash;the grandest, haughtiest queen that you could dream
of&mdash;and she turned upon us with such words of fire, such
lightning eyes and sweeping of her white hand, that she held us
spellbound in our chairs.&nbsp; Her voice was soft and sweet, and
persuasive at the first, but louder it rang and louder as it
spoke of wrongs and freedom and the joys of death in a good
cause, until it thrilled into my every nerve, and I asked nothing
more than to run out of the cottage and to die then and there in
the cause of my country.&nbsp; And then in an instant she
changed.&nbsp; She was a poor woman now, who had lost her only
child, and who was bewailing it.&nbsp; Her voice was full of
tears, and what she said was so simple, so true, that we both
seemed to see the dead babe stretched there on the carpet before
us, and we could have joined in with words of pity and of
grief.&nbsp; And then, before our cheeks were dry, she was back
into her old self again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How like you that, then?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That was my way in the days when Sally Siddons would turn
green at the name of Polly Hinton.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a fine play,
is <i>Pizarro</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who wrote it, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who wrote it?&nbsp; I never heard.&nbsp; What matter
who did the writing of it!&nbsp; But there are some great lines
for one who knows how they should be spoken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you play no longer, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Jim, I left the boards when&mdash;when I was weary
of them.&nbsp; But my heart goes back to them sometimes.&nbsp; It
seems to me there is no smell like that of the hot oil in the
footlights and of the oranges in the pit.&nbsp; But you are sad,
Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was but the thought of that poor woman and her
child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, never think about her!&nbsp; I will soon wipe her
from your mind.&nbsp; This is &lsquo;Miss Priscilla
Tomboy,&rsquo; from <i>The Romp</i>.&nbsp; You must conceive that
the mother is speaking, and that the forward young minx is
answering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she began a scene between the two of them, so exact in
voice and manner that it seemed to us as if there were really two
folk before us: the stern old mother with her hand up like an
ear-trumpet, and her flouncing, bouncing daughter.&nbsp; Her
great figure danced about with a wonderful lightness, and she
tossed her head and pouted her lips as she answered back to the
old, bent figure that addressed her.&nbsp; Jim and I had
forgotten our tears, and were holding our ribs before she came to
the end of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is better,&rdquo; said she, smiling at our
laughter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would not have you go back to
Friar&rsquo;s Oak with long faces, or maybe they would not let
you come to me again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She vanished into her cupboard, and came out with a bottle and
glass, which she placed upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too young for strong waters,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;but this talking gives one a dryness,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then it was that Boy Jim did a wonderful thing.&nbsp; He rose
from his chair, and he laid his hand upon the bottle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>She looked him in the face, and I can still see those black
eyes of hers softening before the gaze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to have none?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please, don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a quick movement she wrested the bottle out of his hand
and raised it up so that for a moment it entered my head that she
was about to drink it off.&nbsp; Then she flung it through the
open lattice, and we heard the crash of it on the path
outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, Jim!&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;does that satisfy
you?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s long since any one cared whether I drank or
no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too good and kind for that,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I love that
you should think me so.&nbsp; And it would make you happier if I
kept from the brandy, Jim?&nbsp; Well, then, I&rsquo;ll make you
a promise, if you&rsquo;ll make me one in return.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, miss?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No drop shall pass my lips, Jim, if you will swear, wet
or shine, blow or snow, to come up here twice in every week, that
I may see you and speak with you, for, indeed, there are times
when I am very lonesome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So the promise was made, and very faithfully did Jim keep it,
for many a time when I have wanted him to go fishing or
rabbit-snaring, he has remembered that it was his day for Miss
Hinton, and has tramped off to Anstey Cross.&nbsp; At first I
think that she found her share of the bargain hard to keep, and I
have seen Jim come back with a black face on him, as if things
were going amiss.&nbsp; But after a time the fight was
won&mdash;as all fights are won if one does but fight long
enough&mdash;and in the year before my father came back Miss
Hinton had become another woman.&nbsp; And it was not her ways
only, but herself as well, for from being the person that I have
described, she became in one twelve-month as fine a looking lady
as there was in the whole country-side.&nbsp; Jim was prouder of
it by far than of anything he had had a hand in in his life, but
it was only to me that he ever spoke about it, for he had that
tenderness towards her that one has for those whom one has
helped.&nbsp; And she helped him also, for by her talk of the
world and of what she had seen, she took his mind away from the
Sussex country-side and prepared it for a broader life
beyond.&nbsp; So matters stood between them at the time when
peace was made and my father came home from the sea.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">THE PEACE OF AMIENS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Many</span> a woman&rsquo;s knee was on
the ground, and many a woman&rsquo;s soul spent itself in joy and
thankfulness when the news came with the fall of the leaf in 1801
that the preliminaries of peace had been settled.&nbsp; All
England waved her gladness by day and twinkled it by night.&nbsp;
Even in little Friar&rsquo;s Oak we had our flags flying bravely,
and a candle in every window, with a big G.R. guttering in the
wind over the door of the inn.&nbsp; Folk were weary of the war,
for we had been at it for eight years, taking Holland, and Spain,
and France each in turn and all together.&nbsp; All that we had
learned during that time was that our little army was no match
for the French on land, and that our large navy was more than a
match for them upon the water.&nbsp; We had gained some credit,
which we were sorely in need of after the American business; and
a few Colonies, which were welcome also for the same reason; but
our debt had gone on rising and our consols sinking, until even
Pitt stood aghast.&nbsp; Still, if we had known that there never
could be peace between Napoleon and ourselves, and that this was
only the end of a round and not of the battle, we should have
been better advised had we fought it out without a break.&nbsp;
As it was, the French got back the twenty thousand good seamen
whom we had captured, and a fine dance they led us with their
Boulogne flotillas and fleets of invasion before we were able to
catch them again.</p>
<p>My father, as I remember him best, was a tough, strong little
man, of no great breadth, but solid and well put together.&nbsp;
His face was burned of a reddish colour, as bright as a
flower-pot, and in spite of his age (for he was only forty at the
time of which I speak) it was shot with lines, which deepened if
he were in any way perturbed, so that I have seen him turn on the
instant from a youngish man to an elderly.&nbsp; His eyes
especially were meshed round with wrinkles, as is natural for one
who had puckered them all his life in facing foul wind and bitter
weather.&nbsp; These eyes were, perhaps, his strangest feature,
for they were of a very clear and beautiful blue, which shone the
brighter out of that ruddy setting.&nbsp; By nature he must have
been a fair-skinned man, for his upper brow, where his cap came
over it, was as white as mine, and his close-cropped hair was
tawny.</p>
<p>He had served, as he was proud to say, in the last of our
ships which had been chased out of the Mediterranean in
&rsquo;97, and in the first which had re-entered it in
&rsquo;98.&nbsp; He was under Miller, as third lieutenant of the
<i>Theseus</i>, when our fleet, like a pack of eager fox hounds
in a covert, was dashing from Sicily to Syria and back again to
Naples, trying to pick up the lost scent.&nbsp; With the same
good fighting man he served at the Nile, where the men of his
command sponged and rammed and trained until, when the last
tricolour had come down, they hove up the sheet anchor and fell
dead asleep upon the top of each other under the capstan
bars.&nbsp; Then, as a second lieutenant, he was in one of those
grim three-deckers with powder-blackened hulls and crimson
scupper-holes, their spare cables tied round their keels and over
their bulwarks to hold them together, which carried the news into
the Bay of Naples.&nbsp; From thence, as a reward for his
services, he was transferred as first lieutenant to the
<i>Aurora</i> frigate, engaged in cutting off supplies from
Genoa, and in her he still remained until long after peace was
declared.</p>
<p>How well I can remember his home-coming!&nbsp; Though it is
now eight-and-forty years ago, it is clearer to me than the
doings of last week, for the memory of an old man is like one of
those glasses which shows out what is at a distance and blurs all
that is near.</p>
<p>My mother had been in a tremble ever since the first rumour of
the preliminaries came to our ears, for she knew that he might
come as soon as his message.&nbsp; She said little, but she
saddened my life by insisting that I should be for ever clean and
tidy.&nbsp; With every rumble of wheels, too, her eyes would
glance towards the door, and her hands steal up to smooth her
pretty black hair.&nbsp; She had embroidered a white
&ldquo;Welcome&rdquo; upon a blue ground, with an anchor in red
upon each side, and a border of laurel leaves; and this was to
hang upon the two lilac bushes which flanked the cottage
door.&nbsp; He could not have left the Mediterranean before we
had this finished, and every morning she looked to see if it were
in its place and ready to be hanged.</p>
<p>But it was a weary time before the peace was ratified, and it
was April of next year before our great day came round to
us.&nbsp; It had been raining all morning, I remember&mdash;a
soft spring rain, which sent up a rich smell from the brown earth
and pattered pleasantly upon the budding chestnuts behind our
cottage.&nbsp; The sun had shone out in the evening, and I had
come down with my fishing-rod (for I had promised Boy Jim to go
with him to the mill-stream), when what should I see but a
post-chaise with two smoking horses at the gate, and there in the
open door of it were my mother&rsquo;s black skirt and her little
feet jutting out, with two blue arms for a waist-belt, and all
the rest of her buried in the chaise.&nbsp; Away I ran for the
motto, and I pinned it up on the bushes as we had agreed, but
when I had finished there were the skirts and the feet and the
blue arms just the same as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Rod,&rdquo; said my mother at last,
struggling down on to the ground again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Roddy,
darling, here&rsquo;s your father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I saw the red face and the kindly, light-blue eyes looking out
at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Roddy, lad, you were but a child and we kissed
good-bye when last we met; but I suppose we must put you on a
different rating now.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m right glad from my heart to
see you, dear lad; and as to you, sweetheart&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The blue arms flew out, and there were the skirt and the two
feet fixed in the door again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the folk coming, Anson,&rdquo; said my mother,
blushing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you get out and come in with
us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then suddenly it came home to us both that for all his
cheery face he had never moved more than his arms, and that his
leg was resting on the opposite seat of the chaise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Anson, Anson!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, &rsquo;tis but the bone of my leg,&rdquo; said he,
taking his knee between his hands and lifting it round.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I got it broke in the Bay, but the surgeon has fished it
and spliced it, though it&rsquo;s a bit crank yet.&nbsp; Why,
bless her kindly heart, if I haven&rsquo;t turned her from pink
to white.&nbsp; You can see for yourself that it&rsquo;s
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sprang out as he spoke, and with one leg and a staff he
hopped swiftly up the path, and under the laurel-bordered motto,
and so over his own threshold for the first time for five
years.&nbsp; When the post-boy and I had carried up the sea-chest
and the two canvas bags, there he was sitting in his armchair by
the window in his old weather-stained blue coat.&nbsp; My mother
was weeping over his poor leg, and he patting her hair with one
brown hand.&nbsp; His other he threw round my waist, and drew me
to the side of his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that we have peace, I can lie up and refit until
King George needs me again,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas a carronade that came adrift in the Bay when
it was blowing a top-gallant breeze with a beam sea.&nbsp; Ere we
could make it fast it had me jammed against the mast.&nbsp; Well,
well,&rdquo; he added, looking round at the walls of the room,
&ldquo;here are all my old curios, the same as ever: the
narwhal&rsquo;s horn from the Arctic, and the blowfish from the
Moluccas, and the paddles from Fiji, and the picture of the <i>Ca
Ira</i> with Lord Hotham in chase.&nbsp; And here you are, Mary,
and you also, Roddy, and good luck to the carronade which has
sent me into so snug a harbour without fear of sailing
orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mother had his long pipe and his tobacco all ready for him,
so that he was able now to light it and to sit looking from one
of us to the other and then back again, as if he could never see
enough of us.&nbsp; Young as I was, I could still understand that
this was the moment which he had thought of during many a lonely
watch, and that the expectation of it had cheered his heart in
many a dark hour.&nbsp; Sometimes he would touch one of us with
his hand, and sometimes the other, and so he sat, with his soul
too satiated for words, whilst the shadows gathered in the little
room and the lights of the inn windows glimmered through the
gloom.&nbsp; And then, after my mother had lit our own lamp, she
slipped suddenly down upon her knees, and he got one knee to the
ground also, so that, hand-in-hand, they joined their thanks to
Heaven for manifold mercies.&nbsp; When I look back at my parents
as they were in those days, it is at that very moment that I can
picture them most clearly: her sweet face with the wet shining
upon her cheeks, and his blue eyes upturned to the
smoke-blackened ceiling.&nbsp; I remember that he swayed his
reeking pipe in the earnestness of his prayer, so that I was half
tears and half smiles as I watched him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Roddy, lad,&rdquo; said he, after supper was over,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re getting a man now, and I suppose you will go
afloat like the rest of us.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re old enough to
strap a dirk to your thigh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And leave me without a child as well as without a
husband!&rdquo; cried my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s time enough yet,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;for they are more inclined to empty berths than to fill
them, now that peace has come.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve never tried
what all this schooling has done for you, Rodney.&nbsp; You have
had a great deal more than ever I had, but I dare say I can make
shift to test it.&nbsp; Have you learned history?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; said I, with some confidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how many sail of the line were at the Battle of
Camperdown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head gravely when he found that I could not
answer him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, there are men in the fleet who never had any
schooling at all who could tell you that we had seven 74&rsquo;s,
seven 64&rsquo;s, and two 50-gun ships in the action.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s a picture on the wall of the chase of the <i>Ca
Ira</i>.&nbsp; Which were the ships that laid her
aboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I had to confess that he had beaten me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, your dad can teach you something in history
yet,&rdquo; he cried, looking in triumph at my mother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Have you learned geography?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father,&rdquo; said I, though with less confidence
than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, how far is it from Port Mahon to
Algeciras?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could only shake my head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Ushant lay three leagues upon your starboard
quarter, what would be your nearest English port?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I had to give it up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see that your geography is much
better than your history,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d never get your certificate at this rate.&nbsp;
Can you do addition?&nbsp; Well, then, let us see if you can tot
up my prize-money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shot a mischievous glance at my mother as he spoke, and she
laid down her knitting on her lap and looked very earnestly at
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never asked me about that, Mary,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Mediterranean is not the station for it,
Anson.&nbsp; I have heard you say that it is the Atlantic for
prize-money, and the Mediterranean for honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a share of both last cruise, which comes from
changing a line-of-battleship for a frigate.&nbsp; Now, Rodney,
there are two pounds in every hundred due to me when the
prize-courts have done with them.&nbsp; When we were watching
Massena, off Genoa, we got a matter of seventy schooners, brigs,
and tartans, with wine, food, and powder.&nbsp; Lord Keith will
want his finger in the pie, but that&rsquo;s for the Courts to
settle.&nbsp; Put them at four pounds apiece to me, and what will
the seventy bring?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two hundred and eighty pounds,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Anson, it is a fortune!&rdquo; cried my mother,
clapping her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try you again, Roddy!&rdquo; said he, shaking his pipe
at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;There was the <i>Xebec</i> frigate out of
Barcelona with twenty thousand Spanish dollars aboard, which make
four thousand of our pounds.&nbsp; Her hull should be worth
another thousand.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s my share of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the purser couldn&rsquo;t work it out
quicker,&rdquo; he cried in his delight.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s for you again!&nbsp; We passed the Straits
and worked up to the Azores, where we fell in with the <i>La
Sabina</i> from the Mauritius with sugar and spices.&nbsp; Twelve
hundred pounds she&rsquo;s worth to me, Mary, my darling, and
never again shall you soil your pretty fingers or pinch upon my
beggarly pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dear mother had borne her long struggle without a sign all
these years, but now that she was so suddenly eased of it she
fell sobbing upon his neck.&nbsp; It was a long time before my
father had a thought to spare upon my examination in
arithmetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all in your lap, Mary,&rdquo; said he,
dashing his own hand across his eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;By George,
lass, when this leg of mine is sound we&rsquo;ll bear down for a
spell to Brighton, and if there is a smarter frock than yours
upon the Steyne, may I never tread a poop again.&nbsp; But how is
it that you are so quick at figures, Rodney, when you know
nothing of history or geography?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried to explain that addition was the same upon sea or
land, but that history and geography were not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he concluded, &ldquo;you need figures to
take a reckoning, and you need nothing else save what your mother
wit will teach you.&nbsp; There never was one of our breed who
did not take to salt water like a young gull.&nbsp; Lord Nelson
has promised me a vacancy for you, and he&rsquo;ll be as good as
his word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So it was that my father came home to us, and a better or
kinder no lad could wish for.&nbsp; Though my parents had been
married so long, they had really seen very little of each other,
and their affection was as warm and as fresh as if they were two
newly-wedded lovers.&nbsp; I have learned since that sailors can
be coarse and foul, but never did I know it from my father; for,
although he had seen as much rough work as the wildest could wish
for, he was always the same patient, good-humoured man, with a
smile and a jolly word for all the village.&nbsp; He could suit
himself to his company, too, for on the one hand he could take
his wine with the vicar, or with Sir James Ovington, the squire
of the parish; while on the other he would sit by the hour
amongst my humble friends down in the smithy, with Champion
Harrison, Boy Jim, and the rest of them, telling them such
stories of Nelson and his men that I have seen the Champion knot
his great hands together, while Jim&rsquo;s eyes have smouldered
like the forge embers as he listened.</p>
<p>My father had been placed on half-pay, like so many others of
the old war officers, and so, for nearly two years, he was able
to remain with us.&nbsp; During all this time I can only once
remember that there was the slightest disagreement between him
and my mother.&nbsp; It chanced that I was the cause of it, and
as great events sprang out of it, I must tell you how it came
about.&nbsp; It was indeed the first of a series of events which
affected not only my fortunes, but those of very much more
important people.</p>
<p>The spring of 1803 was an early one, and the middle of April
saw the leaves thick upon the chestnut trees.&nbsp; One evening
we were all seated together over a dish of tea when we heard the
scrunch of steps outside our door, and there was the postman with
a letter in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is for me,&rdquo; said my mother, and sure
enough it was addressed in the most beautiful writing to Mrs.
Mary Stone, of Friar&rsquo;s Oak, and there was a red seal the
size of a half-crown upon the outside of it with a flying dragon
in the middle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom think you that it is from, Anson?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had hoped that it was from Lord Nelson,&rdquo;
answered my father.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is time the boy had his
commission.&nbsp; But if it be for you, then it cannot be from
any one of much importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can it not!&rdquo; she cried, pretending to be
offended.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will ask my pardon for that speech,
sir, for it is from no less a person than Sir Charles Tregellis,
my own brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mother seemed to speak with a hushed voice when she
mentioned this wonderful brother of hers, and always had done as
long as I can remember, so that I had learned also to have a
subdued and reverent feeling when I heard his name.&nbsp; And
indeed it was no wonder, for that name was never mentioned unless
it were in connection with something brilliant and
extraordinary.&nbsp; Once we heard that he was at Windsor with
the King.&nbsp; Often he was at Brighton with the Prince.&nbsp;
Sometimes it was as a sportsman that his reputation reached us,
as when his Meteor beat the Duke of Queensberry&rsquo;s Egham, at
Newmarket, or when he brought Jim Belcher up from Bristol, and
sprang him upon the London fancy.&nbsp; But usually it was as the
friend of the great, the arbiter of fashions, the king of bucks,
and the best-dressed man in town that his reputation reached
us.&nbsp; My father, however, did not appear to be elated at my
mother&rsquo;s triumphant rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, and what does he want?&rdquo; asked he, in no very
amiable voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wrote to him, Anson, and told him that Rodney was
growing a man now, thinking, since he had no wife or child of his
own, he might be disposed to advance him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can do very well without him,&rdquo; growled my
father.&nbsp; &ldquo;He sheered off from us when the weather was
foul, and we have no need of him now that the sun is
shining.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, you misjudge him, Anson,&rdquo; said my mother,
warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no one with a better heart than
Charles; but his own life moves so smoothly that he cannot
understand that others may have trouble.&nbsp; During all these
years I have known that I had but to say the word to receive as
much as I wished from him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God that you never had to stoop to it,
Mary.&nbsp; I want none of his help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we must think of Rodney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rodney has enough for his sea-chest and kit.&nbsp; He
needs no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Charles has great power and influence in
London.&nbsp; He could make Rodney known to all the great
people.&nbsp; Surely you would not stand in the way of his
advancement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hear what he says, then,&rdquo; said my father;
and this was the letter which she read to him&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: right">14, Jermyn Street, St.
James&rsquo;s,<br />
&ldquo;April 15th, 1803.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">My dear Sister Mary</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;In answer to your letter, I can assure you that you
must not conceive me to be wanting in those finer feelings which
are the chief adornment of humanity.&nbsp; It is true that for
some years, absorbed as I have been in affairs of the highest
importance, I have seldom taken a pen in hand, for which I can
assure you that I have been reproached by many <i>des plus
charmantes</i> of your charming sex.&nbsp; At the present moment
I lie abed (having stayed late in order to pay a compliment to
the Marchioness of Dover at her ball last night), and this is
writ to my dictation by Ambrose, my clever rascal of a
valet.&nbsp; I am interested to hear of my nephew Rodney (<i>Mon
dieu</i>, <i>quel nom</i>!), and as I shall be on my way to visit
the Prince at Brighton next week, I shall break my journey at
Friar&rsquo;s Oak for the sake of seeing both you and him.&nbsp;
Make my compliments to your husband.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;I am ever, my dear sister
Mary,<br />
&ldquo;Your brother,<br />
&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Charles Tregellis</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo; cried my mother in
triumph when she had finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think it is the letter of a fop,&rdquo; said my
father, bluntly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too hard on him, Anson.&nbsp; You will think
better of him when you know him.&nbsp; But he says that he will
be here next week, and this is Thursday, and the best curtains
unhung, and no lavender in the sheets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away she bustled, half distracted, while my father sat moody,
with his chin upon his hands, and I remained lost in wonder at
the thought of this grand new relative from London, and of all
that his coming might mean to us.</p>
<h2><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>CHAPTER V.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">BUCK TREGELLIS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Now</span> that I was in my seventeenth
year, and had already some need for a razor, I had begun to weary
of the narrow life of the village, and to long to see something
of the great world beyond.&nbsp; The craving was all the stronger
because I durst not speak openly about it, for the least hint of
it brought the tears into my mother&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; But now
there was the less reason that I should stay at home, since my
father was at her side, and so my mind was all filled by this
prospect of my uncle&rsquo;s visit, and of the chance that he
might set my feet moving at last upon the road of life.</p>
<p>As you may think, it was towards my father&rsquo;s profession
that my thoughts and my hopes turned, for from my childhood I
have never seen the heave of the sea or tasted the salt upon my
lips without feeling the blood of five generations of seamen
thrill within my veins.&nbsp; And think of the challenge which
was ever waving in those days before the eyes of a coast-living
lad!&nbsp; I had but to walk up to Wolstonbury in the war time to
see the sails of the French chasse-mar&eacute;es and
privateers.&nbsp; Again and again I have heard the roar of the
guns coming from far out over the waters.&nbsp; Seamen would tell
us how they had left London and been engaged ere nightfall, or
sailed out of Portsmouth and been yard-arm to yard-arm before
they had lost sight of St. Helen&rsquo;s light.&nbsp; It was this
imminence of the danger which warmed our hearts to our sailors,
and made us talk, round the winter fires, of our little Nelson,
and Cuddie Collingwood, and Johnnie Jarvis, and the rest of them,
not as being great High Admirals with titles and dignities, but
as good friends whom we loved and honoured above all
others.&nbsp; What boy was there through the length and breadth
of Britain who did not long to be out with them under the
red-cross flag?</p>
<p>But now that peace had come, and the fleets which had swept
the Channel and the Mediterranean were lying dismantled in our
harbours, there was less to draw one&rsquo;s fancy
seawards.&nbsp; It was London now of which I thought by day and
brooded by night: the huge city, the home of the wise and the
great, from which came this constant stream of carriages, and
those crowds of dusty people who were for ever flashing past our
window-pane.&nbsp; It was this one side of life which first
presented itself to me, and so, as a boy, I used to picture the
City as a gigantic stable with a huge huddle of coaches, which
were for ever streaming off down the country roads.&nbsp; But,
then, Champion Harrison told me how the fighting-men lived there,
and my father how the heads of the Navy lived there, and my
mother how her brother and his grand friends were there, until at
last I was consumed with impatience to see this marvellous heart
of England.&nbsp; This coming of my uncle, then, was the breaking
of light through the darkness, though I hardly dared to hope that
he would take me with him into those high circles in which he
lived.&nbsp; My mother, however, had such confidence either in
his good nature or in her own powers of persuasion, that she
already began to make furtive preparations for my departure.</p>
<p>But if the narrowness of the village life chafed my easy
spirit, it was a torture to the keen and ardent mind of Boy
Jim.&nbsp; It was but a few days after the coming of my
uncle&rsquo;s letter that we walked over the Downs together, and
I had a peep of the bitterness of his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is there for me to do, Rodney?&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I forge a shoe, and I fuller it, and I clip
it, and I caulken it, and I knock five holes in it, and there it
is finished.&nbsp; Then I do it again and again, and blow up the
bellows and feed the forge, and rasp a hoof or two, and there is
a day&rsquo;s work done, and every day the same as the
other.&nbsp; Was it for this only, do you think, that I was born
into the world?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at him, his proud, eagle face, and his tall, sinewy
figure, and I wondered whether in the whole land there was a
finer, handsomer man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Army or the Navy is the place for you, Jim,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very well,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
go into the Navy, as you are likely to do, you go as an officer,
and it is you who do the ordering.&nbsp; If I go in, it is as one
who was born to receive orders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An officer gets his orders from those above
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But an officer does not have the lash hung over his
head.&nbsp; I saw a poor fellow at the inn here&mdash;it was some
years ago&mdash;who showed us his back in the tap-room, all cut
into red diamonds with the boat-swain&rsquo;s whip.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Who ordered that?&rsquo; I asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
captain,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;And what would you have had
if you had struck him dead?&rsquo; said I.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
yard-arm,&rsquo; he answered.&nbsp; &lsquo;Then if I had been you
that&rsquo;s where I should have been,&rsquo; said I, and I spoke
the truth.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t help it, Rod!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
something here in my heart, something that is as much a part of
myself as this hand is, which holds me to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that you are as proud as Lucifer,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was born with me, Roddy, and I can&rsquo;t help
it.&nbsp; Life would be easier if I could.&nbsp; I was made to be
my own master, and there&rsquo;s only one place where I can hope
to be so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is that, Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In London.&nbsp; Miss Hinton has told me of it, until I
feel as if I could find my way through it from end to end.&nbsp;
She loves to talk of it as well as I do to listen.&nbsp; I have
it all laid out in my mind, and I can see where the playhouses
are, and how the river runs, and where the King&rsquo;s house is,
and the Prince&rsquo;s, and the place where the fighting-men
live.&nbsp; I could make my name known in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind how, Rod.&nbsp; I could do it, and I will do
it, too.&nbsp; &lsquo;Wait!&rsquo; says my
uncle&mdash;&lsquo;wait, and it will all come right for
you.&rsquo;&nbsp; That is what he always says, and my aunt the
same.&nbsp; Why should I wait?&nbsp; What am I to wait for?&nbsp;
No, Roddy, I&rsquo;ll stay no longer eating my heart out in this
little village, but I&rsquo;ll leave my apron behind me and
I&rsquo;ll seek my fortune in London, and when I come back to
Friar&rsquo;s Oak, it will be in such style as that gentleman
yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pointed as he spoke, and there was a high crimson curricle
coming down the London road, with two bay mares harnessed tandem
fashion before it.&nbsp; The reins and fittings were of a light
fawn colour, and the gentleman had a driving-coat to match, with
a servant in dark livery behind.&nbsp; They flashed past us in a
rolling cloud of dust, and I had just a glimpse of the pale,
handsome face of the master, and of the dark, shrivelled features
of the man.&nbsp; I should never have given them another thought
had it not chanced that when the village came into view there was
the curricle again, standing at the door of the inn, and the
grooms busy taking out the horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I believe it is my
uncle!&rdquo; and taking to my heels I ran for home at the top of
my speed.&nbsp; At the door was standing the dark-faced
servant.&nbsp; He carried a cushion, upon which lay a small and
fluffy lapdog.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will excuse me, young sir,&rdquo; said he, in the
suavest, most soothing of voices, &ldquo;but am I right in
supposing that this is the house of Lieutenant Stone?&nbsp; In
that case you will, perhaps, do me the favour to hand to Mrs.
Stone this note which her brother, Sir Charles Tregellis, has
just committed to my care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was quite abashed by the man&rsquo;s flowery way of
talking&mdash;so unlike anything which I had ever heard.&nbsp; He
had a wizened face, and sharp little dark eyes, which took in me
and the house and my mother&rsquo;s startled face at the window
all in the instant.&nbsp; My parents were together, the two of
them, in the sitting-room, and my mother read the note to us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Mary,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;I have stopped at
the inn, because I am somewhat <i>ravag&eacute;</i> by the dust
of your Sussex roads.&nbsp; A lavender-water bath may restore me
to a condition in which I may fitly pay my compliments to a
lady.&nbsp; Meantime, I send you Fidelio as a hostage.&nbsp; Pray
give him a half-pint of warmish milk with six drops of pure
brandy in it.&nbsp; A better or more faithful creature never
lived.&nbsp; <i>Toujours &agrave;
toi</i>.&mdash;Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have him in!&nbsp; Have him in!&rdquo; cried my father,
heartily, running to the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come in, Mr.
Fidelio.&nbsp; Every man to his own taste, and six drops to the
half-pint seems a sinful watering of grog&mdash;but if you like
it so, you shall have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile flickered over the dark face of the servant, but his
features reset themselves instantly into their usual mask of
respectful observance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are labouring under a slight error, sir, if you
will permit me to say so.&nbsp; My name is Ambrose, and I have
the honour to be the valet of Sir Charles Tregellis.&nbsp; This
is Fidelio upon the cushion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, the dog!&rdquo; cried my father, in disgust.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Heave him down by the fireside.&nbsp; Why should he have
brandy, when many a Christian has to go without?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, Anson!&rdquo; said my mother, taking the
cushion.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will tell Sir Charles that his wishes
shall be carried out, and that we shall expect him at his own
convenience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man went off noiselessly and swiftly, but was back in a
few minutes with a flat brown basket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the refection, madam,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will you permit me to lay the table?&nbsp; Sir Charles is
accustomed to partake of certain dishes and to drink certain
wines, so that we usually bring them with us when we
visit.&rdquo;&nbsp; He opened the basket, and in a minute he had
the table all shining with silver and glass, and studded with
dainty dishes.&nbsp; So quick and neat and silent was he in all
he did, that my father was as taken with him as I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have made a right good foretopman if your
heart is as stout as your fingers are quick,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you never wish to have the honour of serving
your country?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my honour, sir, to serve Sir Charles Tregellis,
and I desire no other master,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I will convey his dressing-case from the inn, and then
all will be ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came back with a great silver-mounted box under his arm,
and close at his heels was the gentleman whose coming had made
such a disturbance.</p>
<p>My first impression of my uncle as he entered the room was
that one of his eyes was swollen to the size of an apple.&nbsp;
It caught the breath from my lips&mdash;that monstrous,
glistening eye.&nbsp; But the next instant I perceived that he
held a round glass in the front of it, which magnified it in this
fashion.&nbsp; He looked at us each in turn, and then he bowed
very gracefully to my mother and kissed her upon either
cheek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will permit me to compliment you, my dear
Mary,&rdquo; said he, in a voice which was the most mellow and
beautiful that I have ever heard.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can assure you
that the country air has used you wondrous well, and that I
should be proud to see my pretty sister in the Mall.&nbsp; I am
your servant, sir,&rdquo; he continued, holding out his hand to
my father.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was but last week that I had the
honour of dining with my friend, Lord St. Vincent, and I took
occasion to mention you to him.&nbsp; I may tell you that your
name is not forgotten at the Admiralty, sir, and I hope that I
may see you soon walking the poop of a 74-gun ship of your
own.&nbsp; So this is my nephew, is it?&rdquo;&nbsp; He put a
hand upon each of my shoulders in a very friendly way and looked
me up and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you, nephew?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look older.&nbsp; You look eighteen, at the
least.&nbsp; I find him very passable, Mary&mdash;very passable,
indeed.&nbsp; He has not the <i>bel</i> air, the
<i>tournure</i>&mdash;in our uncouth English we have no word for
it.&nbsp; But he is as healthy as a May-hedge in
bloom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So within a minute of his entering our door he had got himself
upon terms with all of us, and with so easy and graceful a manner
that it seemed as if he had known us all for years.&nbsp; I had a
good look at him now as he stood upon the hearthrug with my
mother upon one side and my father on the other.&nbsp; He was a
very large man, with noble shoulders, small waist, broad hips,
well-turned legs, and the smallest of hands and feet.&nbsp; His
face was pale and handsome, with a prominent chin, a jutting
nose, and large blue staring eyes, in which a sort of dancing,
mischievous light was for ever playing.&nbsp; He wore a deep
brown coat with a collar as high as his ears and tails as low as
his knees.&nbsp; His black breeches and silk stockings ended in
very small pointed shoes, so highly polished that they twinkled
with every movement.&nbsp; His vest was of black velvet, open at
the top to show an embroidered shirt-front, with a high, smooth,
white cravat above it, which kept his neck for ever on the
stretch.&nbsp; He stood easily, with one thumb in the arm-pit,
and two fingers of the other hand in his vest pocket.&nbsp; It
made me proud as I watched him to think that so magnificent a
man, with such easy, masterful ways, should be my own blood
relation, and I could see from my mother&rsquo;s eyes as they
turned towards him that the same thought was in her mind.</p>
<p>All this time Ambrose had been standing like a dark-clothed,
bronze-faced image by the door, with the big silver-bound box
under his arm.&nbsp; He stepped forward now into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I convey it to your bedchamber, Sir
Charles?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, pardon me, sister Mary,&rdquo; cried my uncle,
&ldquo;I am old-fashioned enough to have principles&mdash;an
anachronism, I know, in this lax age.&nbsp; One of them is never
to allow my <i>batterie de toilette</i> out of my sight when I am
travelling.&nbsp; I cannot readily forget the agonies which I
endured some years ago through neglecting this precaution.&nbsp;
I will do Ambrose the justice to say that it was before he took
charge of my affairs.&nbsp; I was compelled to wear the same
ruffles upon two consecutive days.&nbsp; On the third morning my
fellow was so affected by the sight of my condition, that he
burst into tears and laid out a pair which he had stolen from
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke his face was very grave, but the light in his eyes
danced and gleamed.&nbsp; He handed his open snuff-box to my
father, as Ambrose followed my mother out of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You number yourself in an illustrious company by upping
your finger and thumb into it,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir!&rdquo; said my father, shortly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are free of my box, as being a relative by
marriage.&nbsp; You are free also, nephew, and I pray you to take
a pinch.&nbsp; It is the most intimate sign of my goodwill.&nbsp;
Outside ourselves there are four, I think, who have had access to
it&mdash;the Prince, of course; Mr Pitt; Monsieur Otto, the
French Ambassador; and Lord Hawkesbury.&nbsp; I have sometimes
thought that I was premature with Lord Hawkesbury.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am vastly honoured, sir,&rdquo; said my father,
looking suspiciously at his guest from under his shaggy eyebrows,
for with that grave face and those twinkling eyes it was hard to
know how to take him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman, sir, has her love to bestow,&rdquo; said my
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;A man has his snuff-box.&nbsp; Neither is to
be lightly offered.&nbsp; It is a lapse of taste; nay, more, it
is a breach of morals.&nbsp; Only the other day, as I was seated
in Watier&rsquo;s, my box of prime macouba open upon the table
beside me, an Irish bishop thrust in his intrusive fingers.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Waiter,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;my box has been
soiled!&nbsp; Remove it!&rsquo;&nbsp; The man meant no insult,
you understand, but that class of people must be kept in their
proper sphere.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A bishop!&rdquo; cried my father.&nbsp; &ldquo;You draw
your line very high, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said my uncle; &ldquo;I wish no better
epitaph upon my tombstone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My mother had in the meanwhile descended, and we all drew up
to the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will excuse my apparent grossness, Mary, in
venturing to bring my own larder with me.&nbsp; Abernethy has me
under his orders, and I must eschew your rich country
dainties.&nbsp; A little white wine and a cold bird&mdash;it is
as much as the niggardly Scotchman will allow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should have you on blockading service when the
levanters are blowing,&rdquo; said my father.&nbsp; &ldquo;Salt
junk and weevilly biscuits, with a rib of a tough Barbary ox when
the tenders come in.&nbsp; You would have your spare diet there,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straightway my uncle began to question him about the sea
service, and for the whole meal my father was telling him of the
Nile and of the Toulon blockade, and the siege of Genoa, and all
that he had seen and done.&nbsp; But whenever he faltered for a
word, my uncle always had it ready for him, and it was hard to
say which knew most about the business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I read little or nothing,&rdquo; said he, when my
father marvelled where he got his knowledge.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
fact is that I can hardly pick up a print without seeing some
allusion to myself: &lsquo;Sir C. T. does this,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;Sir C. T. says the other,&rsquo; so I take them no
longer.&nbsp; But if a man is in my position all knowledge comes
to him.&nbsp; The Duke of York tells me of the Army in the
morning, and Lord Spencer chats with me of the Navy in the
afternoon, and Dundas whispers me what is going forward in the
Cabinet, so that I have little need of the <i>Times</i> or the
<i>Morning Chronicle</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This set him talking of the great world of London, telling my
father about the men who were his masters at the Admiralty, and
my mother about the beauties of the town, and the great ladies at
Almack&rsquo;s, but all in the same light, fanciful way, so that
one never knew whether to laugh or to take him gravely.&nbsp; I
think it flattered him to see the way in which we all three hung
upon his words.&nbsp; Of some he thought highly and of some
lowly, but he made no secret that the highest of all, and the one
against whom all others should be measured, was Sir Charles
Tregellis himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the King,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;of course, I am
<i>l&rsquo;ami de famille</i> there; and even with you I can
scarce speak freely, as my relations are confidential.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless him and keep him from ill!&rdquo; cried my
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is pleasant to hear you say so,&rdquo; said my
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;One has to come into the country to hear
honest loyalty, for a sneer and a gibe are more the fashions in
town.&nbsp; The King is grateful to me for the interest which I
have ever shown in his son.&nbsp; He likes to think that the
Prince has a man of taste in his circle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the Prince?&rdquo; asked my mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is
he well-favoured?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a fine figure of a man.&nbsp; At a distance he
has been mistaken for me.&nbsp; And he has some taste in dress,
though he gets slovenly if I am too long away from him.&nbsp; I
warrant you that I find a crease in his coat
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were all seated round the fire by this time, for the
evening had turned chilly.&nbsp; The lamp was lighted and so also
was my father&rsquo;s pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that this is your
first visit to Friar&rsquo;s Oak?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle&rsquo;s face turned suddenly very grave and
stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my first visit for many years,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was but one-and-twenty years of age when last
I came here.&nbsp; I am not likely to forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew that he spoke of his visit to Cliffe Royal at the time
of the murder, and I saw by her face that my mother knew it
also.&nbsp; My father, however, had either never heard of it, or
had forgotten the circumstance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it at the inn you stayed?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stayed with the unfortunate Lord Avon.&nbsp; It was
the occasion when he was accused of slaying his younger brother
and fled from the country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all fell silent, and my uncle leaned his chin upon his
hand, looking thoughtfully into the fire.&nbsp; If I do but close
my eyes now, I can see the light upon his proud, handsome face,
and see also my dear father, concerned at having touched upon so
terrible a memory, shooting little slanting glances at him
betwixt the puffs of his pipe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say that it has happened with you, sir,&rdquo;
said my uncle at last, &ldquo;that you have lost some dear
messmate, in battle or wreck, and that you have put him out of
your mind in the routine of your daily life, until suddenly some
word or some scene brings him back to your memory, and you find
your sorrow as raw as upon the first day of your loss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is with me to-night.&nbsp; I never formed a close
friendship with a man&mdash;I say nothing of women&mdash;save
only the once.&nbsp; That was with Lord Avon.&nbsp; We were of an
age, he a few years perhaps my senior, but our tastes, our
judgments, and our characters were alike, save only that he had
in him a touch of pride such as I have never known in any other
man.&nbsp; Putting aside the little foibles of a rich young man
of fashion, <i>les indescr&eacute;tions d&rsquo;une jeunesse
dor&eacute;e</i>, I could have sworn that he was as good a man as
I have ever known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How came he, then, to such a crime?&rdquo; asked my
father.</p>
<p>My uncle shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many a time have I asked myself that question, and it
comes home to me more to-night than ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All the jauntiness had gone out of his manner, and he had
turned suddenly into a sad and serious man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it certain that he did it, Charles?&rdquo; asked my
mother.</p>
<p>My uncle shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could think it were not so.&nbsp; I have
thought sometimes that it was this very pride, turning suddenly
to madness, which drove him to it.&nbsp; You have heard how he
returned the money which we had lost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, I have heard nothing of it,&rdquo; my father
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very old story now, though we have not yet
found an end to it.&nbsp; We had played for two days, the four of
us: Lord Avon, his brother Captain Barrington, Sir Lothian Hume,
and myself.&nbsp; Of the Captain I knew little, save that he was
not of the best repute, and was deep in the hands of the
Jews.&nbsp; Sir Lothian has made an evil name for himself
since&mdash;&rsquo;tis the same Sir Lothian who shot Lord Carton
in the affair at Chalk Farm&mdash;but in those days there was
nothing against him.&nbsp; The oldest of us was but twenty-four,
and we gamed on, as I say, until the Captain had cleared the
board.&nbsp; We were all hit, but our host far the hardest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That night&mdash;I tell you now what it would be a
bitter thing for me to tell in a court of law&mdash;I was
restless and sleepless, as often happens when a man has kept
awake over long.&nbsp; My mind would dwell upon the fall of the
cards, and I was tossing and turning in my bed, when suddenly a
cry fell upon my ears, and then a second louder one, coming from
the direction of Captain Barrington&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; Five
minutes later I heard steps passing down the passage, and,
without striking a light, I opened my door and peeped out,
thinking that some one was taken unwell.&nbsp; There was Lord
Avon walking towards me.&nbsp; In one hand he held a guttering
candle and in the other a brown bag, which chinked as he
moved.&nbsp; His face was all drawn and distorted&mdash;so much
so that my question was frozen upon my lips.&nbsp; Before I could
utter it he turned into his chamber and softly closed the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next morning I was awakened by finding him at my
bedside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Charles,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I cannot abide
to think that you should have lost this money in my house.&nbsp;
You will find it here upon your table.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was in vain that I laughed at his squeamishness,
telling him that I should most certainly have claimed my money
had I won, so that it would be strange indeed if I were not
permitted to pay it when I lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Neither I nor my brother will touch it,&rsquo;
said he.&nbsp; &lsquo;There it lies, and you may do what you like
about it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would listen to no argument, but dashed out of the
room like a madman.&nbsp; But perhaps these details are familiar
to you, and God knows they are painful to me to tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father was sitting with staring eyes, and his forgotten
pipe reeking in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray let us hear the end of it, sir,&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I had finished my toilet in an hour or
so&mdash;for I was less exigeant in those days than now&mdash;and
I met Sir Lothian Hume at breakfast.&nbsp; His experience had
been the same as my own, and he was eager to see Captain
Barrington; and to ascertain why he had directed his brother to
return the money to us.&nbsp; We were talking the matter over
when suddenly I raised my eyes to the corner of the ceiling, and
I saw&mdash;I saw&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle had turned quite pale with the vividness of the
memory, and he passed his hand over his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was crimson,&rdquo; said he, with a
shudder&mdash;&ldquo;crimson with black cracks, and from every
crack&mdash;but I will give you dreams, sister Mary.&nbsp;
Suffice it that we rushed up the stair which led direct to the
Captain&rsquo;s room, and there we found him lying with the bone
gleaming white through his throat.&nbsp; A hunting-knife lay in
the room&mdash;and the knife was Lord Avon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; A lace
ruffle was found in the dead man&rsquo;s grasp&mdash;and the
ruffle was Lord Avon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Some papers were found
charred in the grate&mdash;and the papers were Lord
Avon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Oh, my poor friend, in what moment of madness
did you come to do such a deed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The light had gone out of my uncle&rsquo;s eyes and the
extravagance from his manner.&nbsp; His speech was clear and
plain, with none of those strange London ways which had so amazed
me.&nbsp; Here was a second uncle, a man of heart and a man of
brains, and I liked him better than the first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what said Lord Avon?&rdquo; cried my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said nothing.&nbsp; He went about like one who walks
in his sleep, with horror-stricken eyes.&nbsp; None dared arrest
him until there should be due inquiry, but when the
coroner&rsquo;s court brought wilful murder against him, the
constables came for him in full cry.&nbsp; But they found him
fled.&nbsp; There was a rumour that he had been seen in
Westminster in the next week, and then that he had escaped for
America, but nothing more is known.&nbsp; It will be a bright day
for Sir Lothian Hume when they can prove him dead, for he is next
of kin, and till then he can touch neither title nor
estate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The telling of this grim story had cast a chill upon all of
us.&nbsp; My uncle held out his hands towards the blaze, and I
noticed that they were as white as the ruffles which fringed
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know not how things are at Cliffe Royal now,&rdquo;
said he, thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was not a cheery house,
even before this shadow fell upon it.&nbsp; A fitter stage was
never set forth for such a tragedy.&nbsp; But seventeen years
have passed, and perhaps even that horrible
ceiling&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It still bears the stain,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>I know not which of the three was the more astonished, for my
mother had not heard of my adventures of the night.&nbsp; They
never took their wondering eyes off me as I told my story, and my
heart swelled with pride when my uncle said that we had carried
ourselves well, and that he did not think that many of our age
would have stood it as stoutly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But as to this ghost, it must have been the creature of
your own minds,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Imagination plays us
strange tricks, and though I have as steady a nerve as a man
might wish, I cannot answer for what I might see if I were to
stand under that blood-stained ceiling at midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I saw a figure as plainly
as I see that fire, and I heard the steps as clearly as I hear
the crackle of the fagots.&nbsp; Besides, we could not both be
deceived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is truth in that,&rdquo; said be,
thoughtfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;You saw no features, you
say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was too dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But only a figure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dark outline of one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And it retreated up the stairs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And vanished into the wall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What part of the wall?&rdquo; cried a voice from behind
us.</p>
<p>My mother screamed, and down came my father&rsquo;s pipe on to
the hearthrug.&nbsp; I had sprung round with a catch of my
breath, and there was the valet, Ambrose, his body in the shadow
of the doorway, his dark face protruded into the light, and two
burning eyes fixed upon mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the deuce is the meaning of this, sir?&rdquo;
cried my uncle.</p>
<p>It was strange to see the gleam and passion fade out of the
man&rsquo;s face, and the demure mask of the valet replace
it.&nbsp; His eyes still smouldered, but his features regained
their prim composure in an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I had come in to ask you if you had any orders for me, and
I did not like to interrupt the young gentleman&rsquo;s
story.&nbsp; I am afraid that I have been somewhat carried away
by it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew you forget yourself before,&rdquo; said my
uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, I am sure, forgive me, Sir Charles, if you
will call to mind the relation in which I stood to Lord
Avon.&rdquo;&nbsp; He spoke with some dignity of manner, and with
a bow he left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make some little allowance,&rdquo; said my
uncle, with a sudden return to his jaunty manner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When a man can brew a dish of chocolate, or tie a cravat,
as Ambrose does, he may claim consideration.&nbsp; The fact is
that the poor fellow was valet to Lord Avon, that he was at
Cliffe Royal upon the fatal night of which I have spoken, and
that he is most devoted to his old master.&nbsp; But my talk has
been somewhat <i>triste</i>, sister Mary, and now we shall
return, if you please, to the dresses of the Countess Lieven, and
the gossip of St. James.&rdquo;</p>

86</span>CHAPTER VI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON THE THRESHOLD.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> father sent me to bed early that
night, though I was very eager to stay up, for every word which
this man said held my attention.&nbsp; His face, his manner, the
large waves and sweeps of his white hands, his easy air of
superiority, his fantastic fashion of talk, all filled me with
interest and wonder.&nbsp; But, as I afterwards learned, their
conversation was to be about myself and my own prospects, so I
was despatched to my room, whence far into the night I could hear
the deep growl of my father and the rich tones of my uncle, with
an occasional gentle murmur from my mother, as they talked in the
room beneath.</p>
<p>I had dropped asleep at last, when I was awakened suddenly by
something wet being pressed against my face, and by two warm arms
which were cast round me.&nbsp; My mother&rsquo;s cheek was
against my own, and I could hear the click of her sobs, and feel
her quiver and shake in the darkness.&nbsp; A faint light stole
through the latticed window, and I could dimly see that she was
in white, with her black hair loose upon her shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t forget us, Roddy?&nbsp; You won&rsquo;t
forget us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, mother, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle, Roddy&mdash;he is going to take you away
from us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When, mother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>God forgive me, how my heart bounded for joy, when hers, which
was within touch of it, was breaking with sorrow!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mother!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;To
London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First to Brighton, that he may present you to the
Prince.&nbsp; Next day to London, where you will meet the great
people, Roddy, and learn to look down upon&mdash;to look down
upon your poor, simple, old-fashioned father and
mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put my arms about her to console her, but she wept so that,
for all my seventeen years and pride of manhood, it set me
weeping also, and with such a hiccoughing noise, since I had not
a woman&rsquo;s knack of quiet tears, that it finally turned her
own grief to laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charles would be flattered if he could see the gracious
way in which we receive his kindness,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Be still, Roddy dear, or you will certainly wake
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not go if it is to grieve you,&rdquo; I
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, dear, you must go, for it may be the one great
chance of your life.&nbsp; And think how proud it will make us
all when we hear of you in the company of Charles&rsquo;s grand
friends.&nbsp; But you will promise me not to gamble,
Roddy?&nbsp; You heard to-night of the dreadful things which come
from it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you will be careful of wine, Roddy?&nbsp; You are
young and unused to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And play-actresses also, Roddy.&nbsp; And you will not
cast your underclothing until June is in.&nbsp; Young Master
Overton came by his death through it.&nbsp; Think well of your
dress, Roddy, so as to do your uncle credit, for it is the thing
for which he is himself most famed.&nbsp; You have but to do what
he will direct.&nbsp; But if there is a time when you are not
meeting grand people, you can wear out your country things, for
your brown coat is as good as new, and the blue one, if it were
ironed and relined, would take you through the summer.&nbsp; I
have put out your Sunday clothes with the nankeen vest, since you
are to see the Prince to-morrow, and you will wear your brown
silk stockings and buckle shoes.&nbsp; Be guarded in crossing the
London streets, for I am told that the hackney coaches are past
all imagining.&nbsp; Fold your clothes when you go to bed, Roddy,
and do not forget your evening prayers, for, oh, my dear boy, the
days of temptation are at hand, when I will no longer be with you
to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So with advice and guidance both for this world and the next
did my mother, with her soft, warm arms around me, prepare me for
the great step which lay before me.</p>
<p>My uncle did not appear at breakfast in the morning, but
Ambrose brewed him a dish of chocolate and took it to his
room.&nbsp; When at last, about midday, he did descend, he was so
fine with his curled hair, his shining teeth, his quizzing glass,
his snow-white ruffles, and his laughing eyes, that I could not
take my gaze from him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nephew,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;what do you think
of the prospect of coming to town with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you, sir, for the kind interest which you take
in me,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must be a credit to me.&nbsp; My nephew must be
of the best if he is to be in keeping with the rest of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find him a chip of good wood, sir,&rdquo;
said my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must make him a polished chip before we have done
with him.&nbsp; Your aim, my dear nephew, must always be to be in
<i>bon ton</i>.&nbsp; It is not a case of wealth, you
understand.&nbsp; Mere riches cannot do it.&nbsp; Golden Price
has forty thousand a year, but his clothes are disastrous.&nbsp;
I assure you that I saw him come down St. James&rsquo;s Street
the other day, and I was so shocked at his appearance that I had
to step into Vernet&rsquo;s for a glass of orange brandy.&nbsp;
No, it is a question of natural taste, and of following the
advice and example of those who are more experienced than
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear, Charles, that Roddy&rsquo;s wardrobe is
country-made,&rdquo; said my mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall soon set that right when we get to town.&nbsp;
We shall see what Stultz or Weston can do for him,&rdquo; my
uncle answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must keep him quiet until he has
some clothes to wear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This slight upon my best Sunday suit brought a flush to my
mother&rsquo;s cheeks, which my uncle instantly observed, for he
was quick in noticing trifles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The clothes are very well for Friar&rsquo;s Oak, sister
Mary,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;And yet you can understand
that they might seem <i>rococo</i> in the Mall.&nbsp; If you
leave him in my hands I shall see to the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On how much, sir,&rdquo; asked my father, &ldquo;can a
young man dress in town?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With prudence and reasonable care, a young man of
fashion can dress upon eight hundred a year,&rdquo; my uncle
answered.</p>
<p>I saw my poor father&rsquo;s face grow longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear, sir, that Roddy must keep his country
clothes,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even with my
prize-money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, sir!&rdquo; cried my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I already
owe Weston something over a thousand, so how can a few odd
hundreds affect it?&nbsp; If my nephew comes with me, my nephew
is my care.&nbsp; The point is settled, and I must refuse to
argue upon it.&rdquo;&nbsp; He waved his white hands as if to
brush aside all opposition.</p>
<p>My parents tried to thank him, but he cut them short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, now that I am in Friar&rsquo;s Oak, there
is another small piece of business which I have to
perform,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe that there is a
fighting-man named Harrison here, who at one time might have held
the championship.&nbsp; In those days poor Avon and I were his
principal backers.&nbsp; I should like to have a word with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may think how proud I was to walk down the village street
with my magnificent relative, and to note out of the corner of my
eye how the folk came to the doors and windows to see us
pass.&nbsp; Champion Harrison was standing outside the smithy,
and he pulled his cap off when he saw my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God bless me, sir!&nbsp; Who&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; thought
of seem&rsquo; you at Friar&rsquo;s Oak?&nbsp; Why, Sir Charles,
it brings old memories back to look at your face
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you looking so fit, Harrison,&rdquo; said
my uncle, running his eyes over him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, with a
week&rsquo;s training you would be as good a man as ever.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t suppose you scale more than thirteen and a
half?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thirteen ten, Sir Charles.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m in my
fortieth year, but I am sound in wind and limb, and if my old
woman would have let me off my promise, I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; had a
try with some of these young ones before now.&nbsp; I hear that
they&rsquo;ve got some amazin&rsquo; good stuff up from Bristol
of late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the Bristol yellowman has been the winning colour
of late.&nbsp; How d&rsquo;ye do, Mrs. Harrison?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t suppose you remember me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had come out from the house, and I noticed that her worn
face&mdash;on which some past terror seemed to have left its
shadow&mdash;hardened into stern lines as she looked at my
uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember you too well, Sir Charles Tregellis,&rdquo;
said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I trust that you have not come here to-day
to try to draw my husband back into the ways that he has
forsaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way with her, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said
Harrison, resting his great hand upon the woman&rsquo;s
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s got my promise, and she holds
me to it!&nbsp; There was never a better or more hard-working
wife, but she ain&rsquo;t what you&rsquo;d call a patron of
sport, and that&rsquo;s a fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sport!&rdquo; cried the woman, bitterly.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
fine sport for you, Sir Charles, with your pleasant twenty-mile
drive into the country and your luncheon-basket and your wines,
and so merrily back to London in the cool of the evening, with a
well-fought battle to talk over.&nbsp; Think of the sport that it
was to me to sit through the long hours, listening for the wheels
of the chaise which would bring my man back to me.&nbsp;
Sometimes he could walk in, and sometimes he was led in, and
sometimes he was carried in, and it was only by his clothes that
I could know him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, wifie,&rdquo; said Harrison, patting her on the
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been cut up in my time, but
never as bad as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then to live for weeks afterwards with the fear
that every knock at the door may be to tell us that the other is
dead, and that my man may have to stand in the dock and take his
trial for murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, she hasn&rsquo;t got a sportin&rsquo; drop in her
veins,&rdquo; said Harrison.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;d never make
a patron, never!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Black Baruk&rsquo;s business
that did it, when we thought he&rsquo;d napped it once too
often.&nbsp; Well, she has my promise, and I&rsquo;ll never sling
my hat over the ropes unless she gives me leave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll keep your hat on your head like an honest,
God-fearing man, John,&rdquo; said his wife, turning back into
the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t for the world say anything to make you
change your resolutions,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;At
the same time, if you had wished to take a turn at the old sport,
I had a good thing to put in your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s no use, sir,&rdquo; said Harrison,
&ldquo;but I&rsquo;d be glad to hear about it all the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have a very good bit of stuff at thirteen stone
down Gloucester way.&nbsp; Wilson is his name, and they call him
Crab on account of his style.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harrison shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Never heard of him,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very likely not, for he has never shown in the
P.R.&nbsp; But they think great things of him in the West, and he
can hold his own with either of the Belchers with the
mufflers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sparrin&rsquo; ain&rsquo;t fightin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said
the smith</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am told that he had the best of it in a by-battle
with Noah James, of Cheshire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no gamer man on the list, sir, than Noah
James, the guardsman,&rdquo; said Harrison.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw
him myself fight fifty rounds after his jaw had been cracked in
three places.&nbsp; If Wilson could beat him, Wilson will go
far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So they think in the West, and they mean to spring him
on the London talent.&nbsp; Sir Lothian Hume is his patron, and
to make a long story short, he lays me odds that I won&rsquo;t
find a young one of his weight to meet him.&nbsp; I told him that
I had not heard of any good young ones, but that I had an old one
who had not put his foot into a ring for many years, who would
make his man wish he had never come to London.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Young or old, under twenty or over thirty-five,
you may bring whom you will at the weight, and I shall lay two to
one on Wilson,&rsquo; said he.&nbsp; I took him in thousands, and
here I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said the smith,
shaking his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing would please
me better, but you heard for yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if you won&rsquo;t fight, Harrison, I must try to
get some promising colt.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d be glad of your advice
in the matter.&nbsp; By the way, I take the chair at a supper of
the Fancy at the Waggon and Horses in St. Martin&rsquo;s Lane
next Friday.&nbsp; I should be very glad if you will make one of
my guests.&nbsp; Halloa, who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;&nbsp; Up flew
his glass to his eye.</p>
<p>Boy Jim had come out from the forge with his hammer in his
hand.&nbsp; He had, I remember, a grey flannel shirt, which was
open at the neck and turned up at the sleeves.&nbsp; My uncle ran
his eyes over the fine lines of his magnificent figure with the
glance of a connoisseur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my nephew, Sir Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he living with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His parents are dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he ever been in London?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Sir Charles.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been with me here
since he was as high as that hammer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle turned to Boy Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear that you have never been in London,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your uncle is coming up to a supper which I am
giving to the Fancy next Friday.&nbsp; Would you care to make one
of us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boy Jim&rsquo;s dark eyes sparkled with pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to come, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Jim,&rdquo; cried the smith, abruptly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry to gainsay you, lad, but there are reasons
why I had rather you stayed down here with your aunt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, Harrison, let the lad come!&rdquo; cried my
uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Sir Charles.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s dangerous company
for a lad of his mettle.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s plenty for him to do
when I&rsquo;m away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poor Jim turned away with a clouded brow and strode into the
smithy again.&nbsp; For my part, I slipped after him to try to
console him, and to tell him all the wonderful changes which had
come so suddenly into my life.&nbsp; But I had not got half
through my story, and Jim, like the good fellow that he was, had
just begun to forget his own troubles in his delight at my good
fortune, when my uncle called to me from without.&nbsp; The
curricle with its tandem mares was waiting for us outside the
cottage, and Ambrose had placed the refection-basket, the
lap-dog, and the precious toilet-box inside of it.&nbsp; He had
himself climbed up behind, and I, after a hearty handshake from
my father, and a last sobbing embrace from my mother, took my
place beside my uncle in the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go her head!&rdquo; cried he to the ostler, and
with a snap, a crack, and a jingle, away we went upon our
journey.</p>
<p>Across all the years how clearly I can see that spring day,
with the green English fields, the windy English sky, and the
yellow, beetle-browed cottage in which I had grown from a child
to a man.&nbsp; I see, too, the figures at the garden gate: my
mother, with her face turned away and her handkerchief waving; my
father, with his blue coat and his white shorts, leaning upon his
stick with his hand shading his eyes as he peered after us.&nbsp;
All the village was out to see young Roddy Stone go off with his
grand relative from London to call upon the Prince in his own
palace.&nbsp; The Harrisons were waving to me from the smithy,
and John Cummings from the steps of the inn, and I saw Joshua
Allen, my old schoolmaster, pointing me out to the people, as if
he were showing what came from his teaching.&nbsp; To make it
complete, who should drive past just as we cleared the village
but Miss Hinton, the play-actress, the pony and phaeton the same
as when first I saw her, but she herself another woman; and I
thought to myself that if Boy Jim had done nothing but that one
thing, he need not think that his youth had been wasted in the
country.&nbsp; She was driving to see him, I have no doubt, for
they were closer than ever, and she never looked up nor saw the
hand that I waved to her.&nbsp; So as we took the curve of the
road the little village vanished, and there in the dip of the
Downs, past the spires of Patcham and of Preston, lay the broad
blue sea and the grey houses of Brighton, with the strange
Eastern domes and minarets of the Prince&rsquo;s Pavilion
shooting out from the centre of it.</p>
<p>To every traveller it was a sight of beauty, but to me it was
the world&mdash;the great wide free world&mdash;and my heart
thrilled and fluttered as the young bird&rsquo;s may when it
first hears the whirr of its own flight, and skims along with the
blue heaven above it and the green fields beneath.&nbsp; The day
may come when it may look back regretfully to the snug nest in
the thornbush, but what does it reck of that when spring is in
the air and youth in its blood, and the old hawk of trouble has
not yet darkened the sunshine with the ill-boding shadow of its
wings?</p>
<h2><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>CHAPTER VII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE HOPE OF ENGLAND.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> uncle drove for some time in
silence, but I was conscious that his eye was always coming round
to me, and I had an uneasy conviction that he was already
beginning to ask himself whether he could make anything of me, or
whether he had been betrayed into an indiscretion when he had
allowed his sister to persuade him to show her son something of
the grand world in which he lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You sing, don&rsquo;t you, nephew?&rdquo; he asked,
suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, a little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A baritone, I should fancy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your mother tells me that you play the
fiddle.&nbsp; These things will be of service to you with the
Prince.&nbsp; Music runs in his family.&nbsp; Your education has
been what you could get at a village school.&nbsp; Well, you are
not examined in Greek roots in polite society, which is lucky for
some of us.&nbsp; It is as well just to have a tag or two of
Horace or Virgil: &lsquo;sub tegmine fagi,&rsquo; or &lsquo;habet
f&oelig;num in cornu,&rsquo; which gives a flavour to one&rsquo;s
conversation like the touch of garlic in a salad.&nbsp; It is not
<i>bon ton</i> to be learned, but it is a graceful thing to
indicate that you have forgotten a good deal.&nbsp; Can you write
verse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear not, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A small book of rhymes may be had for half a
crown.&nbsp; Vers de Soci&eacute;t&eacute; are a great assistance
to a young man.&nbsp; If you have the ladies on your side, it
does not matter whom you have against you.&nbsp; You must learn
to open a door, to enter a room, to present a snuff-box, raising
the lid with the forefinger of the hand in which you hold
it.&nbsp; You must acquire the bow for a man, with its necessary
touch of dignity, and that for a lady, which cannot be too
humble, and should still contain the least suspicion of
abandon.&nbsp; You must cultivate a manner with women which shall
be deprecating and yet audacious.&nbsp; Have you any
eccentricity?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It made me laugh, the easy way in which he asked the question,
as if it were a most natural thing to possess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a pleasant, catching laugh, at all
events,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;But an eccentricity is very
<i>bon ton</i> at present, and if you feel any leaning towards
one, I should certainly advise you to let it run its
course.&nbsp; Petersham would have remained a mere peer all his
life had it not come out that he had a snuff-box for every day in
the year, and that he had caught cold through a mistake of his
valet, who sent him out on a bitter winter day with a thin
S&egrave;vres china box instead of a thick tortoiseshell.&nbsp;
That brought him out of the ruck, you see, and people remember
him.&nbsp; Even some small characteristic, such as having an
apricot tart on your sideboard all the year round, or putting
your candle out at night by stuffing it under your pillow, serves
to separate you from your neighbour.&nbsp; In my own case, it is
my precise judgment upon matter of dress and decorum which has
placed me where I am.&nbsp; I do not profess to follow a
law.&nbsp; I set one.&nbsp; For example, I am taking you to-day
to see the Prince in a nankeen vest.&nbsp; What do you think will
be the consequence of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My fears told me that it might be my own very great
discomfiture, but I did not say so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, the night coach will carry the news to
London.&nbsp; It will be in Brookes&rsquo;s and White&rsquo;s
to-morrow morning.&nbsp; Within, a week St. James&rsquo;s Street
and the Mall will be full of nankeen waistcoats.&nbsp; A most
painful incident happened to me once.&nbsp; My cravat came undone
in the street, and I actually walked from Carlton House to
Watier&rsquo;s in Bruton Street with the two ends hanging
loose.&nbsp; Do you suppose it shook my position?&nbsp; The same
evening there were dozens of young bloods walking the streets of
London with their cravats loose.&nbsp; If I had not rearranged
mine there would not be one tied in the whole kingdom now, and a
great art would have been prematurely lost.&nbsp; You have not
yet began to practise it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I confessed that I had not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should begin now in your youth.&nbsp; I will myself
teach you the <i>coup d&rsquo;archet</i>.&nbsp; By using a few
hours in each day, which would otherwise be wasted, you may hope
to have excellent cravats in middle life.&nbsp; The whole knack
lies in pointing your chin to the sky, and then arranging your
folds by the gradual descent of your lower jaw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When my uncle spoke like this there was always that dancing,
mischievous light in his dark blue eyes, which showed me that
this humour of his was a conscious eccentricity, depending, as I
believe, upon a natural fastidiousness of taste, but wilfully
driven to grotesque lengths for the very reason which made him
recommend me also to develop some peculiarity of my own.&nbsp;
When I thought of the way in which he had spoken of his unhappy
friend, Lord Avon, upon the evening before, and of the emotion
which he showed as he told the horrible story, I was glad to
think that there was the heart of a man there, however much it
might please him to conceal it.</p>
<p>And, as it happened, I was very soon to have another peep at
it, for a most unexpected event befell us as we drew up in front
of the Crown hotel.&nbsp; A swarm of ostlers and grooms had
rushed out to us, and my uncle, throwing down the reins, gathered
Fidelio on his cushion from under the seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ambrose,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you may take
Fidelio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there came no answer.&nbsp; The seat behind was
unoccupied.&nbsp; Ambrose was gone.</p>
<p>We could hardly believe our eyes when we alighted and found
that it was really so.&nbsp; He had most certainly taken his seat
there at Friar&rsquo;s Oak, and from there on we had come without
a break as fast as the mares could travel.&nbsp; Whither, then,
could he have vanished to?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s fallen off in a fit!&rdquo; cried my
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d drive back, but the Prince is
expecting us.&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s the landlord?&nbsp; Here,
Coppinger, send your best man back to Friar&rsquo;s Oak as fast
as his horse can go, to find news of my valet, Ambrose.&nbsp; See
that no pains be spared.&nbsp; Now, nephew, we shall lunch, and
then go up to the Pavilion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle was much disturbed by the strange loss of his valet,
the more so as it was his custom to go through a whole series of
washings and changings after even the shortest journey.&nbsp; For
my own part, mindful of my mother&rsquo;s advice, I carefully
brushed the dust from my clothes and made myself as neat as
possible.&nbsp; My heart was down in the soles of my little
silver-buckled shoes now that I had the immediate prospect of
meeting so great and terrible a person as the Prince of
Wales.&nbsp; I had seen his flaring yellow barouche flying
through Friar&rsquo;s Oak many a time, and had halloaed and waved
my hat with the others as it passed, but never in my wildest
dreams had it entered my head that I should ever be called upon
to look him in the face and answer his questions.&nbsp; My mother
had taught me to regard him with reverence, as one of those whom
God had placed to rule over us; but my uncle smiled when I told
him of her teaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are old enough to see things as they are,
nephew,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and your knowledge of them is the
badge that you are in that inner circle where I mean to place
you.&nbsp; There is no one who knows the Prince better than I do,
and there is no one who trusts him less.&nbsp; A stranger
contradiction of qualities was never gathered under one
hat.&nbsp; He is a man who is always in a hurry, and yet has
never anything to do.&nbsp; He fusses about things with which he
has no concern, and he neglects every obvious duty.&nbsp; He is
generous to those who have no claim upon him, but he has ruined
his tradesmen by refusing to pay his just debts.&nbsp; He is
affectionate to casual acquaintances, but he dislikes his father,
loathes his mother, and is not on speaking terms with his
wife.&nbsp; He claims to be the first gentleman of England, but
the gentlemen of England have responded by blackballing his
friends at their clubs, and by warning him off from Newmarket
under suspicion of having tampered with a horse.&nbsp; He spends
his days in uttering noble sentiments, and contradicting them by
ignoble actions.&nbsp; He tells stories of his own doings which
are so grotesque that they can only be explained by the madness
which runs in his blood.&nbsp; And yet, with all this, he can be
courteous, dignified, and kindly upon occasion, and I have seen
an impulsive good-heartedness in the man which has made me
overlook faults which come mainly from his being placed in a
position which no one upon this earth was ever less fitted to
fill.&nbsp; But this is between ourselves, nephew; and now you
will come with me and you will form an opinion for
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was but a short walk, and yet it took us some time, for my
uncle stalked along with great dignity, his lace-bordered
handkerchief in one hand, and his cane with the clouded amber
head dangling from the other.&nbsp; Every one that we met seemed
to know him, and their hats flew from their heads as we
passed.&nbsp; He took little notice of these greetings, save to
give a nod to one, or to slightly raise his forefinger to
another.&nbsp; It chanced, however, that as we turned into the
Pavilion Grounds, we met a magnificent team of four coal-black
horses, driven by a rough-looking, middle-aged fellow in an old
weather-stained cape.&nbsp; There was nothing that I could see to
distinguish him from any professional driver, save that he was
chatting very freely with a dainty little woman who was perched
on the box beside him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa, Charlie!&nbsp; Good drive down?&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>My uncle bowed and smiled to the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broke it at Friar&rsquo;s Oak,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve my light curricle and two new mares&mdash;half
thorough-bred, half Cleveland bay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you think of my team of blacks?&rdquo;
asked the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir Charles, what d&rsquo;you think of them?&nbsp;
Ain&rsquo;t they damnation smart?&rdquo; cried the little
woman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plenty of power.&nbsp; Good horses for the Sussex
clay.&nbsp; Too thick about the fetlocks for me.&nbsp; I like to
travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Travel!&rdquo; cried the woman, with extraordinary
vehemence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, what the&mdash;&rdquo; and she broke
into such language as I had never heard from a man&rsquo;s lips
before.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;d start with our swingle-bars
touching, and we&rsquo;d have your dinner ordered, cooked, laid,
and eaten before you were there to claim it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By George, yes, Letty is right!&rdquo; cried the
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&rsquo;you start to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Jack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll make you an offer.&nbsp; Look ye here,
Charlie!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll spring my cattle from the Castle Square
at quarter before nine.&nbsp; You can follow as the clock
strikes.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve double the horses and double the
weight.&nbsp; If you so much as see me before we cross
Westminster Bridge, I&rsquo;ll pay you a cool hundred.&nbsp; If
not, it&rsquo;s my money&mdash;play or pay.&nbsp; Is it a
match?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said my uncle, and, raising his hat,
he led the way into the grounds.&nbsp; As I followed, I saw the
woman take the reins, while the man looked after us, and squirted
a jet of tobacco-juice from between his teeth in coachman
fashion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s Sir John Lade,&rdquo; said my uncle,
&ldquo;one of the richest men and best whips in England.&nbsp;
There isn&rsquo;t a professional on the road that can handle
either his tongue or his ribbons better; but his wife, Lady
Letty, is his match with the one or the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was dreadful to hear her,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s her eccentricity.&nbsp; We all have
them; and she amuses the Prince.&nbsp; Now, nephew, keep close at
my elbow, and have your eyes open and your mouth shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two lines of magnificent red and gold footmen who guarded the
door bowed deeply as my uncle and I passed between them, he with
his head in the air and a manner as if he entered into his own,
whilst I tried to look assured, though my heart was beating thin
and fast.&nbsp; Within there was a high and large hall,
ornamented with Eastern decorations, which harmonized with the
domes and minarets of the exterior.&nbsp; A number of people were
moving quietly about, forming into groups and whispering to each
other.&nbsp; One of these, a short, burly, red-faced man, full of
fuss and self-importance, came hurrying up to my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have de goot news, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said he,
sinking his voice as one who speaks of weighty measures.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>Es ist vollendet</i>&mdash;dat is, I have it at last
thoroughly done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, serve it hot,&rdquo; said my uncle, coldly,
&ldquo;and see that the sauces are a little better than when last
I dined at Carlton House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, mine Gott, you tink I talk of de cuisine.&nbsp; It
is de affair of de Prince dat I speak of.&nbsp; Dat is one little
<i>vol-au-vent</i> dat is worth one hundred tousand pound.&nbsp;
Ten per cent., and double to be repaid when de Royal pappa
die.&nbsp; <i>Alles ist fertig</i>.&nbsp; Goldshmidt of de Hague
have took it up, and de Dutch public has subscribe de
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help the Dutch public!&rdquo; muttered my uncle, as
the fat little man bustled off with his news to some
new-comer.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the Prince&rsquo;s famous
cook, nephew.&nbsp; He has not his equal in England for a
<i>filet saut&eacute; aux champignons</i>.&nbsp; He manages his
master&rsquo;s money affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cook!&rdquo; I exclaimed, in bewilderment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look surprised, nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought that some respectable banking
firm&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle inclined his lips to my ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No respectable house would touch them,&rdquo; he
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, Mellish, is the Prince
within?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the private saloon, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said the
gentleman addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any one with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sheridan and Francis.&nbsp; He said he expected
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we shall go through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I followed him through the strangest succession of rooms, full
of curious barbaric splendour which impressed me as being very
rich and wonderful, though perhaps I should think differently
now.&nbsp; Gold and scarlet in arabesque designs gleamed upon the
walls, with gilt dragons and monsters writhing along cornices and
out of corners.&nbsp; Look where I would, on panel or ceiling, a
score of mirrors flashed back the picture of the tall, proud,
white-faced man, and the youth who walked so demurely at his
elbow.&nbsp; Finally, a footman opened a door, and we found
ourselves in the Prince&rsquo;s own private apartment.</p>
<p>Two gentlemen were lounging in a very easy fashion upon
luxurious fauteuils at the further end of the room and a third
stood between them, his thick, well-formed legs somewhat apart
and his hands clasped behind him.&nbsp; The sun was shining in
upon them through a side-window, and I can see the three faces
now&mdash;one in the dusk, one in the light, and one cut across
by the shadow.&nbsp; Of those at the sides, I recall the reddish
nose and dark, flashing eyes of the one, and the hard, austere
face of the other, with the high coat-collars and many-wreathed
cravats.&nbsp; These I took in at a glance, but it was upon the
man in the centre that my gaze was fixed, for this I knew must be
the Prince of Wales.</p>
<p>George was then in his forty-first year, and with the help of
his tailor and his hairdresser, he might have passed as somewhat
less.&nbsp; The sight of him put me at my ease, for he was a
merry-looking man, handsome too in a portly, full-blooded way,
with laughing eyes and pouting, sensitive lips.&nbsp; His nose
was turned upwards, which increased the good-humoured effect of
his countenance at the expense of its dignity.&nbsp; His cheeks
were pale and sodden, like those of a man who lived too well and
took too little exercise.&nbsp; He was dressed in a
single-breasted black coat buttoned up, a pair of leather
pantaloons stretched tightly across his broad thighs, polished
Hessian boots, and a huge white neckcloth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa, Tregellis!&rdquo; he cried, in the cheeriest
fashion, as my uncle crossed the threshold, and then suddenly the
smile faded from his face, and his eyes gleamed with
resentment.&nbsp; &ldquo;What the deuce is this?&rdquo; he
shouted, angrily.</p>
<p>A thrill of fear passed through me as I thought that it was my
appearance which had produced this outburst.&nbsp; But his eyes
were gazing past us, and glancing round we saw that a man in a
brown coat and scratch wig had followed so closely at our heels,
that the footmen had let him pass under the impression that he
was of our party.&nbsp; His face was very red, and the folded
blue paper which he carried in his hand shook and crackled in his
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Vuillamy, the furniture man,&rdquo;
cried the Prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;What, am I to be dunned in my own
private room?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s Mellish?&nbsp; Where&rsquo;s
Townshend?&nbsp; What the deuce is Tom Tring doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have intruded, your Royal Highness,
but I must have the money&mdash;or even a thousand on account
would do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must have it, must you, Vuillamy?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a
fine word to use.&nbsp; I pay my debts in my own time, and
I&rsquo;m not to be bullied.&nbsp; Turn him out, footman!&nbsp;
Take him away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t get it by Monday, I shall be in your
papa&rsquo;s Bench,&rdquo; wailed the little man, and as the
footman led him out we could hear him, amidst shouts of laughter,
still protesting that he would wind up in &ldquo;papa&rsquo;s
Bench.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the very place for a furniture man,&rdquo;
said the man with the red nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It should be the longest bench in the world,
Sherry,&rdquo; answered the Prince, &ldquo;for a good many of his
subjects will want seats on it.&nbsp; Very glad to see you back,
Tregellis, but you must really be more careful what you bring in
upon your skirts.&nbsp; It was only yesterday that we had an
infernal Dutchman here howling about some arrears of interest and
the deuce knows what.&nbsp; &lsquo;My good fellow,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;as long as the Commons starve me, I have to starve
you,&rsquo; and so the matter ended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, sir, that the Commons would respond now if the
matter were fairly put before them by Charlie Fox or
myself,&rdquo; said Sheridan.</p>
<p>The Prince burst out against the Commons with an energy of
hatred that one would scarce expect from that chubby,
good-humoured face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, curse them!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;After
all their preaching and throwing my father&rsquo;s model life, as
they called it, in my teeth, they had to pay <i>his</i> debts to
the tune of nearly a million, whilst I can&rsquo;t get a hundred
thousand out of them.&nbsp; And look at all they&rsquo;ve done
for my brothers!&nbsp; York is Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp; Clarence
is Admiral.&nbsp; What am I?&nbsp; Colonel of a damned dragoon
regiment under the orders of my own younger brother.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s my mother that&rsquo;s at the bottom of it all.&nbsp;
She always tried to hold me back.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s this
you&rsquo;ve brought, Tregellis, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle put his hand on my sleeve and led me forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my sister&rsquo;s son, sir; Rodney Stone by
name,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is coming with me to
London, and I thought it right to begin by presenting him to your
Royal Highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right!&nbsp; Quite right!&rdquo; said the Prince,
with a good-natured smile, patting me in a friendly way upon the
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is your mother living?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are a good son to her you will never go
wrong.&nbsp; And, mark my words, Mr. Rodney Stone, you should
honour the King, love your country, and uphold the glorious
British Constitution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I thought of the energy with which he had just been
cursing the House of Commons, I could scarce keep from smiling,
and I saw Sheridan put his hand up to his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have only to do this, to show a regard for your
word, and to keep out of debt in order to insure a happy and
respected life.&nbsp; What is your father, Mr. Stone?&nbsp; Royal
Navy!&nbsp; Well, it is a glorious service.&nbsp; I have had a
touch of it myself.&nbsp; Did I ever tell you how we laid aboard
the French sloop of war <i>Minerve</i>&mdash;hey,
Tregellis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; Sheridan and
Francis exchanged glances behind the Prince&rsquo;s back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was flying her tricolour out there within sight of
my pavilion windows.&nbsp; Never saw such monstrous impudence in
my life!&nbsp; It would take a man of less mettle than me to
stand it.&nbsp; Out I went in my little cock-boat&mdash;you know
my sixty-ton yawl, Charlie?&mdash;with two four-pounders on each
side, and a six-pounder in the bows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir!&nbsp; Well, sir!&nbsp; And what then,
sir?&rdquo; cried Francis, who appeared to be an irascible,
rough-tongued man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will permit me to tell the story in my own way, Sir
Philip,&rdquo; said the Prince, with dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was
about to say that our metal was so light that I give you my word,
gentlemen, that I carried my port broadside in one coat pocket,
and my starboard in the other.&nbsp; Up we came to the big
Frenchman, took her fire, and scraped the paint off her before we
let drive.&nbsp; But it was no use.&nbsp; By George, gentlemen,
our balls just stuck in her timbers like stones in a mud
wall.&nbsp; She had her nettings up, but we scrambled aboard, and
at it we went hammer and anvil.&nbsp; It was a sharp twenty
minutes, but we beat her people down below, made the hatches fast
on them, and towed her into Seaham.&nbsp; Surely you were with
us, Sherry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in London at the time,&rdquo; said Sheridan,
gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can vouch for it, Francis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can vouch to having heard your Highness tell the
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was a rough little bit of cutlass and pistol
work.&nbsp; But, for my own part, I like the rapier.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a gentleman&rsquo;s weapon.&nbsp; You heard of my bout
with the Chevalier d&rsquo;Eon?&nbsp; I had him at my sword-point
for forty minutes at Angelo&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was one of the best
blades in Europe, but I was a little too supple in the wrist for
him.&nbsp; &lsquo;I thank God there was a button on your
Highness&rsquo;s foil,&rsquo; said he, when we had finished our
breather.&nbsp; By the way, you&rsquo;re a bit of a duellist
yourself, Tregellis.&nbsp; How often have you been
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I used to go when I needed exercise,&rdquo; said my
uncle, carelessly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I have taken to tennis now
instead.&nbsp; A painful incident happened the last time that I
was out, and it sickened me of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You killed your man&mdash;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, sir, it was worse than that.&nbsp; I had a coat
that Weston has never equalled.&nbsp; To say that it fitted me is
not to express it.&nbsp; It <i>was</i> me&mdash;like the hide on
a horse.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve had sixty from him since, but he could
never approach it.&nbsp; The sit of the collar brought tears into
my eyes, sir, when first I saw it; and as to the
waist&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the duel, Tregellis!&rdquo; cried the Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I wore it at the duel, like the thoughtless
fool that I was.&nbsp; It was Major Hunter, of the Guards, with
whom I had had a little <i>tracasserie</i>, because I hinted that
he should not come into Brookes&rsquo;s smelling of the
stables.&nbsp; I fired first, and missed.&nbsp; He fired, and I
shrieked in despair.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s hit!&nbsp; A
surgeon!&nbsp; A surgeon!&rsquo; they cried.&nbsp; &lsquo;A
tailor!&nbsp; A tailor!&rsquo; said I, for there was a double
hole through the tails of my masterpiece.&nbsp; No, it was past
all repair.&nbsp; You may laugh, sir, but I&rsquo;ll never see
the like of it again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had seated myself on a settee in the corner, upon the
Prince&rsquo;s invitation, and very glad I was to remain quiet
and unnoticed, listening to the talk of these men.&nbsp; It was
all in the same extravagant vein, garnished with many senseless
oaths; but I observed this difference, that, whereas my uncle and
Sheridan had something of humour in their exaggeration, Francis
tended always to ill-nature, and the Prince to
self-glorification.&nbsp; Finally, the conversation turned to
music&mdash;I am not sure that my uncle did not artfully bring it
there, and the Prince, hearing from him of my tastes, would have
it that I should then and there sit down at the wonderful little
piano, all inlaid with mother-of-pearl, which stood in the
corner, and play him the accompaniment to his song.&nbsp; It was
called, as I remember, &ldquo;The Briton Conquers but to
Save,&rdquo; and he rolled it out in a very fair bass voice, the
others joining in the chorus, and clapping vigorously when he
finished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo, Mr. Stone!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have
an excellent touch; and I know what I am talking about when I
speak of music.&nbsp; Cramer, of the Opera, said only the other
day that he had rather hand his b&acirc;ton to me than to any
amateur in England.&nbsp; Halloa, it&rsquo;s Charlie Fox, by all
that&rsquo;s wonderful!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had run forward with much warmth, and was shaking the hand
of a singular-looking person who had just entered the room.&nbsp;
The new-comer was a stout, square-built man, plainly and almost
carelessly dressed, with an uncouth manner and a rolling
gait.&nbsp; His age might have been something over fifty, and his
swarthy, harshly-featured face was already deeply lined either by
his years or by his excesses.&nbsp; I have never seen a
countenance in which the angel and the devil were more obviously
wedded.&nbsp; Above, was the high, broad forehead of the
philosopher, with keen, humorous eyes looking out from under
thick, strong brows.&nbsp; Below, was the heavy jowl of the
sensualist curving in a broad crease over his cravat.&nbsp; That
brow was the brow of the public Charles Fox, the thinker, the
philanthropist, the man who rallied and led the Liberal party
during the twenty most hazardous years of its existence.&nbsp;
That jaw was the jaw of the private Charles Fox, the gambler, the
libertine, the drunkard.&nbsp; Yet to his sins he never added the
crowning one of hypocrisy.&nbsp; His vices were as open as his
virtues.&nbsp; In some quaint freak of Nature, two spirits seemed
to have been joined in one body, and the same frame to contain
the best and the worst man of his age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve run down from Chertsey, sir, just to shake
you by the hand, and to make sure that the Tories have not
carried you off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang it, Charlie, you know that I sink or swim with my
friends!&nbsp; A Whig I started, and a Whig I shall
remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought that I could read upon Fox&rsquo;s dark face that he
was by no means so confident about the Prince&rsquo;s
principles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pitt has been at you, sir, I understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, confound him!&nbsp; I hate the sight of that
sharp-pointed snout of his, which he wants to be ever poking into
my affairs.&nbsp; He and Addington have been boggling about the
debts again.&nbsp; Why, look ye, Charlie, if Pitt held me in
contempt he could not behave different.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gathered from the smile which flitted over Sheridan&rsquo;s
expressive face that this was exactly what Pitt did do.&nbsp; But
straightway they all plunged into politics, varied by the
drinking of sweet maraschino, which a footman brought round upon
a salver.&nbsp; The King, the Queen, the Lords, and the Commons
were each in succession cursed by the Prince, in spite of the
excellent advice which he had given me about the British
Constitution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, they allow me so little that I can&rsquo;t look
after my own people.&nbsp; There are a dozen annuities to old
servants and the like, and it&rsquo;s all I can do to scrape the
money together to pay them.&nbsp; However, my&rdquo;&mdash;he
pulled himself up and coughed in a consequential
way&mdash;&ldquo;my financial agent has arranged for a loan,
repayable upon the King&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; This liqueur
isn&rsquo;t good for either of us, Charlie.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
both getting monstrous stout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t get any exercise for the gout,&rdquo;
said Fox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am blooded fifty ounces a month, but the more I take
the more I make.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t think, to look at us,
Tregellis, that we could do what we have done.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve
had some days and nights together, Charlie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fox smiled and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember how we posted to Newmarket before the
races.&nbsp; We took a public coach, Tregellis, clapped the
postillions into the rumble, and jumped on to their places.&nbsp;
Charlie rode the leader and I the wheeler.&nbsp; One fellow
wouldn&rsquo;t let us through his turnpike, and Charlie hopped
off and had his coat off in a minute.&nbsp; The fellow thought he
had to do with a fighting man, and soon cleared the way for
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, sir, speaking of fighting men, I give a
supper to the Fancy at the Waggon and Horses on Friday
next,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you should chance to
be in town, they would think it a great honour if you should
condescend to look in upon us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not seen a fight since I saw Tom Tyne, the
tailor, kill Earl fourteen years ago.&nbsp; I swore off then, and
you know me as a man of my word, Tregellis.&nbsp; Of course,
I&rsquo;ve been at the ringside <i>incog.</i> many a time, but
never as the Prince of Wales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We should be vastly honoured if you would come
<i>incog.</i> to our supper, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, Sherry, make a note of it.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll be at Carlton House on Friday.&nbsp; The Prince
can&rsquo;t come, you know, Tregellis, but you might reserve a
chair for the Earl of Chester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, we shall be proud to see the Earl of Chester
there,&rdquo; said my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, Tregellis,&rdquo; said Fox,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s some rumour about your having a sporting bet
with Sir Lothian Hume.&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the truth of
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a small matter of a couple of thous to a thou, he
giving the odds.&nbsp; He has a fancy to this new Gloucester man,
Crab Wilson, and I&rsquo;m to find a man to beat him.&nbsp;
Anything under twenty or over thirty-five, at or about thirteen
stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take Charlie Fox&rsquo;s advice, then,&rdquo; cried
the Prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;When it comes to handicapping a horse,
playing a hand, matching a cock, or picking a man, he has the
best judgment in England.&nbsp; Now, Charlie, whom have we upon
the list who can beat Crab Wilson, of Gloucester?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was amazed at the interest and knowledge which all these
great people showed about the ring, for they not only had the
deeds of the principal men of the time&mdash;Belcher, Mendoza,
Jackson, or Dutch Sam&mdash;at their fingers&rsquo; ends, but
there was no fighting man so obscure that they did not know the
details of his deeds and prospects.&nbsp; The old ones and then
the young were discussed&mdash;their weight, their gameness,
their hitting power, and their constitution.&nbsp; Who, as he saw
Sheridan and Fox eagerly arguing as to whether Caleb Baldwin, the
Westminster costermonger, could hold his own with Isaac Bittoon,
the Jew, would have guessed that the one was the deepest
political philosopher in Europe, and that the other would be
remembered as the author of the wittiest comedy and of the finest
speech of his generation?</p>
<p>The name of Champion Harrison came very early into the
discussion, and Fox, who had a high idea of Crab Wilson&rsquo;s
powers, was of opinion that my uncle&rsquo;s only chance lay in
the veteran taking the field again.&nbsp; &ldquo;He may be slow
on his pins, but he fights with his head, and he hits like the
kick of a horse.&nbsp; When he finished Black Baruk the man flew
across the outer ring as well as the inner, and fell among the
spectators.&nbsp; If he isn&rsquo;t absolutely stale, Tregellis,
he is your best chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If poor Avon were here we might do something with him,
for he was Harrison&rsquo;s first patron, and the man was devoted
to him.&nbsp; But his wife is too strong for me.&nbsp; And now,
sir, I must leave you, for I have had the misfortune to-day to
lose the best valet in England, and I must make inquiry for
him.&nbsp; I thank your Royal Highness for your kindness in
receiving my nephew in so gracious a fashion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till Friday, then,&rdquo; said the Prince, holding out
his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have to go up to town in any case, for
there is a poor devil of an East India Company&rsquo;s officer
who has written to me in his distress.&nbsp; If I can raise a few
hundreds, I shall see him and set things right for him.&nbsp;
Now, Mr. Stone, you have your life before you, and I hope it will
be one which your uncle may be proud of.&nbsp; You will honour
the King, and show respect for the Constitution, Mr. Stone.&nbsp;
And, hark ye, you will avoid debt, and bear in mind that your
honour is a sacred thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I carried away a last impression of his sensual,
good-humoured face, his high cravat, and his broad leather
thighs.&nbsp; Again we passed the strange rooms, the gilded
monsters, and the gorgeous footmen, and it was with relief that I
found myself out in the open air once more, with the broad blue
sea in front of us, and the fresh evening breeze upon our
faces.</p>
<h2><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE BRIGHTON ROAD.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> uncle and I were up betimes next
morning, but he was much out of temper, for no news had been
heard of his valet Ambrose.&nbsp; He had indeed become like one
of those ants of which I have read, who are so accustomed to be
fed by smaller ants that when they are left to themselves they
die of hunger.&nbsp; It was only by the aid of a man whom the
landlord procured, and of Fox&rsquo;s valet, who had been sent
expressly across, that his toilet was at last performed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must win this race, nephew,&rdquo; said he, when he
had finished breakfast; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t afford to be
beat.&nbsp; Look out of the window and see if the Lades are
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see a red four-in-hand in the square, and there is a
crowd round it.&nbsp; Yes, I see the lady upon the box
seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is our tandem out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is at the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, then, and you shall have such a drive as you
never had before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood at the door pulling on his long brown
driving-gauntlets and giving his orders to the ostlers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every ounce will tell,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll leave that dinner-basket behind.&nbsp; And you
can keep my dog for me, Coppinger.&nbsp; You know him and
understand him.&nbsp; Let him have his warm milk and
cura&ccedil;oa the same as usual.&nbsp; Whoa, my darlings,
you&rsquo;ll have your fill of it before you reach Westminster
Bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I put in the toilet-case?&rdquo; asked the
landlord.&nbsp; I saw the struggle upon my uncle&rsquo;s face,
but he was true to his principles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it under the seat&mdash;the front seat,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nephew, you must keep your weight as far forward
as possible.&nbsp; Can you do anything on a yard of tin?&nbsp;
Well, if you can&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll leave the trumpet.&nbsp;
Buckle that girth up, Thomas.&nbsp; Have you greased the hubs, as
I told you?&nbsp; Well, jump up, nephew, and we&rsquo;ll see them
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Quite a crowd had gathered in the Old Square: men and women,
dark-coated tradesmen, bucks from the Prince&rsquo;s Court, and
officers from Hove, all in a buzz of excitement; for Sir John
Lade and my uncle were two of the most famous whips of the time,
and a match between them was a thing to talk of for many a long
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prince will be sorry to have missed the
start,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t show
before midday.&nbsp; Ah, Jack, good morning!&nbsp; Your servant,
madam!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a fine day for a little bit of
waggoning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As our tandem came alongside of the four-in-hand, with the two
bonny bay mares gleaming like shot-silk in the sunshine, a murmur
of admiration rose from the crowd.&nbsp; My uncle, in his
fawn-coloured driving-coat, with all his harness of the same
tint, looked the ideal of a Corinthian whip; while Sir John Lade,
with his many-caped coat, his white hat, and his rough,
weather-beaten face, might have taken his seat with a line of
professionals upon any ale-house bench without any one being able
to pick him out as one of the wealthiest landowners in
England.&nbsp; It was an age of eccentricity, but he had carried
his peculiarities to a length which surprised even the
out-and-outers by marrying the sweetheart of a famous highwayman
when the gallows had come between her and her lover.&nbsp; She
was perched by his side, looking very smart in a flowered bonnet
and grey travelling-dress, while in front of them the four
splendid coal-black horses, with a flickering touch of gold upon
their powerful, well-curved quarters, were pawing the dust in
their eagerness to be off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hundred that you don&rsquo;t see us before
Westminster with a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s start,&rdquo; said
Sir John.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take you another hundred that we pass
you,&rdquo; answered my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good.&nbsp; Time&rsquo;s up.&nbsp;
Good-bye!&rdquo;&nbsp; He gave a <i>tchk</i> of the tongue, shook
his reins, saluted with his whip; in true coachman&rsquo;s style,
and away he went, taking the curve out of the square in a
workmanlike fashion that fetched a cheer from the crowd.&nbsp; We
heard the dwindling roar of the wheels upon the cobblestones
until they died away in the distance.</p>
<p>It seemed one of the longest quarters of an hour that I had
ever known before the first stroke of nine boomed from the parish
clock.&nbsp; For my part, I was fidgeting in my seat in my
impatience, but my uncle&rsquo;s calm, pale face and large blue
eyes were as tranquil and demure as those of the most unconcerned
spectator.&nbsp; He was keenly on the alert, however, and it
seemed to me that the stroke of the clock and the thong of his
whip fell together&mdash;not in a blow, but in a sharp snap over
the leader, which sent us flying with a jingle and a rattle upon
our fifty miles&rsquo; journey.&nbsp; I heard a roar from behind
us, saw the gliding lines of windows with staring faces and
waving handkerchiefs, and then we were off the stones and on to
the good white road which curved away in front of us, with the
sweep of the green downs upon either side.</p>
<p>I had been provided with shillings that the turnpike-gate
might not stop us, but my uncle reined in the mares and took them
at a very easy trot up all the heavy stretch which ends in
Clayton Hill.&nbsp; He let them go then, and we flashed through
Friar&rsquo;s Oak and across St. John&rsquo;s Common without more
than catching a glimpse of the yellow cottage which contained all
that I loved best.&nbsp; Never have I travelled at such a pace,
and never have I felt such a sense of exhilaration from the rush
of keen upland air upon our faces, and from the sight of those
two glorious creatures stretched to their utmost, with the roar
of their hoofs and the rattle of our wheels as the light curricle
bounded and swayed behind them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long four miles uphill from here to Hand
Cross,&rdquo; said my uncle, as we flew through Cuckfield.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I must ease them a bit, for I cannot afford to break the
hearts of my cattle.&nbsp; They have the right blood in them, and
they would gallop until they dropped if I were brute enough to
let them.&nbsp; Stand up on the seat, nephew, and see if you can
get a glimpse of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I stood up, steadying myself upon my uncle&rsquo;s shoulder,
but though I could see for a mile, or perhaps a quarter more,
there was not a sign of the four-in-hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has sprung his cattle up all these hills
they&rsquo;ll be spent ere they see Croydon,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have four to two,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>J&rsquo;en suis bien s&ucirc;r</i>.&nbsp; Sir
John&rsquo;s black strain makes a good, honest creature, but not
fliers like these.&nbsp; There lies Cuckfield Place, where the
towers are, yonder.&nbsp; Get your weight right forward on the
splashboard now that we are going uphill, nephew.&nbsp; Look at
the action of that leader: did ever you see anything more easy
and more beautiful?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We were taking the hill at a quiet trot, but even so, we made
the carrier, walking in the shadow of his huge, broad-wheeled,
canvas-covered waggon, stare at us in amazement.&nbsp; Close to
Hand Cross we passed the Royal Brighton stage, which had left at
half-past seven, dragging heavily up the slope, and its
passengers, toiling along through the dust behind, gave us a
cheer as we whirled by.&nbsp; At Hand Cross we caught a glimpse
of the old landlord, hurrying out with his gin and his
gingerbread; but the dip of the ground was downwards now, and
away we flew as fast as eight gallant hoofs could take us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you drive, nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very little, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no driving on the Brighton Road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too good a road, nephew.&nbsp; I have only to give them
their heads, and they will race me into Westminster.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t always so.&nbsp; When I was a very young man one
might learn to handle his twenty yards of tape here as well as
elsewhere.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not much really good waggoning now
south of Leicestershire.&nbsp; Show me a man who can hit
&rsquo;em and hold &rsquo;em on a Yorkshire dale-side, and
that&rsquo;s the man who comes from the right school.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had raced over Crawley Down and into the broad main street
of Crawley village, flying between two country waggons in a way
which showed me that even now a driver might do something on the
road.&nbsp; With every turn I peered ahead, looking for our
opponents, but my uncle seemed to concern himself very little
about them, and occupied himself in giving me advice, mixed up
with so many phrases of the craft, that it was all that I could
do to follow him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep a finger for each, or you will have your reins
clubbed,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to the whip, the less
fanning the better if you have willing cattle; but when you want
to put a little life into a coach, see that you get your thong on
to the one that needs it, and don&rsquo;t let it fly round after
you&rsquo;ve hit.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve seen a driver warm up the
off-side passenger on the roof behind him every time he tried to
cut his off-side wheeler.&nbsp; I believe that is their dust over
yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long stretch of road lay before us, barred with the shadows
of wayside trees.&nbsp; Through the green fields a lazy blue
river was drawing itself slowly along, passing under a bridge in
front of us.&nbsp; Beyond was a young fir plantation, and over
its olive line there rose a white whirl which drifted swiftly,
like a cloud-scud on a breezy day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, it&rsquo;s they!&rdquo; cried my uncle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No one else would travel as fast.&nbsp; Come, nephew,
we&rsquo;re half-way when we cross the mole at Kimberham Bridge,
and we&rsquo;ve done it in two hours and fourteen minutes.&nbsp;
The Prince drove to Carlton House with a three tandem in four
hours and a half.&nbsp; The first half is the worst half, and we
might cut his time if all goes well.&nbsp; We should make up
between this and Reigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we flew.&nbsp; The bay mares seemed to know what that
white puff in front of us signified, and they stretched
themselves like greyhounds.&nbsp; We passed a phaeton and pair
London-bound, and we left it behind as if it had been standing
still.&nbsp; Trees, gates, cottages went dancing by.&nbsp; We
heard the folks shouting from the fields, under the impression
that we were a runaway.&nbsp; Faster and faster yet they raced,
the hoofs rattling like castanets, the yellow manes flying, the
wheels buzzing, and every joint and rivet creaking and groaning,
while the curricle swung and swayed until I found myself
clutching to the side-rail.&nbsp; My uncle eased them and glanced
at his watch as we saw the grey tiles and dingy red houses of
Reigate in the hollow beneath us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We did the last six well under twenty minutes,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve time in hand now, and a little
water at the Red Lion will do them no harm.&nbsp; Red
four-in-hand passed, ostler?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just gone, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going hard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Galloping full split, sir!&nbsp; Took the wheel off a
butcher&rsquo;s cart at the corner of the High Street, and was
out o&rsquo; sight before the butcher&rsquo;s boy could see what
had hurt him.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Z-z-z-z-ack</i>! went the long thong, and away we flew once
more.&nbsp; It was market day at Redhill, and the road was
crowded with carts of produce, droves of bullocks, and
farmers&rsquo; gigs.&nbsp; It was a sight to see how my uncle
threaded his way amongst them all.&nbsp; Through the market-place
we dashed amidst the shouting of men, the screaming of women, and
the scuttling of poultry, and then we were out in the country
again, with the long, steep incline of the Redhill Road before
us.&nbsp; My uncle waved his whip in the air with a shrill
view-halloa.</p>
<p>There was the dust-cloud rolling up the hill in front of us,
and through it we had a shadowy peep of the backs of our
opponents, with a flash of brass-work and a gleam of scarlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s half the game won, nephew.&nbsp; Now we
must pass them.&nbsp; Hark forrard, my beauties!&nbsp; By George,
if Kitty isn&rsquo;t foundered!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The leader had suddenly gone dead lame.&nbsp; In an instant we
were both out of the curricle and on our knees beside her.&nbsp;
It was but a stone, wedged between frog and shoe in the off
fore-foot, but it was a minute or two before we could wrench it
out.&nbsp; When we had regained our places the Lades were round
the curve of the hill and out of sight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad luck!&rdquo; growled my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
they can&rsquo;t get away from us!&rdquo;&nbsp; For the first
time he touched the mares up, for he had but cracked the whip
over their heads before.&nbsp; &ldquo;If we catch them in the
next few miles we can spare them for the rest of the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were beginning to show signs of exhaustion.&nbsp; Their
breath came quick and hoarse, and their beautiful coats were
matted with moisture.&nbsp; At the top of the hill, however, they
settled down into their swing once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where on earth have they got to?&rdquo; cried my
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Can you make them out on the road,
nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We could see a long white ribbon of it, all dotted with carts
and waggons coming from Croydon to Redhill, but there was no sign
of the big red four-in-hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they are!&nbsp; Stole away!&nbsp; Stole
away!&rdquo; he cried, wheeling the mares round into a side road
which struck to the right out of that which we had
travelled.&nbsp; &ldquo;There they are, nephew!&nbsp; On the brow
of the hill!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sure enough, on the rise of a curve upon our right the
four-in-hand had appeared, the horses stretched to the
utmost.&nbsp; Our mares laid themselves out gallantly, and the
distance between us began slowly to decrease.&nbsp; I found that
I could see the black band upon Sir John&rsquo;s white hat, then
that I could count the folds of his cape; finally, that I could
see the pretty features of his wife as she looked back at us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re on the side road to Godstone and
Warlingham,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose he
thought that he could make better time by getting out of the way
of the market carts.&nbsp; But we&rsquo;ve got the deuce of a
hill to come down.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll see some fun, nephew, or I
am mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he spoke I suddenly saw the wheels of the four-in-hand
disappear, then the body of it, and then the two figures upon the
box, as suddenly and abruptly as if it had bumped down the first
three steps of some gigantic stairs.&nbsp; An instant later we
had reached the same spot, and there was the road beneath us,
steep and narrow, winding in long curves into the valley.&nbsp;
The four-in-hand was swishing down it as hard as the horses could
gallop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought so!&rdquo; cried my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he
doesn&rsquo;t brake, why should I?&nbsp; Now, my darlings, one
good spurt, and we&rsquo;ll show them the colour of our
tailboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We shot over the brow and flew madly down the hill with the
great red coach roaring and thundering before us.&nbsp; Already
we were in her dust, so that we could see nothing but the dim
scarlet blur in the heart of it, rocking and rolling, with its
outline hardening at every stride.&nbsp; We could hear the crack
of the whip in front of us, and the shrill voice of Lady Lade as
she screamed to the horses.&nbsp; My uncle was very quiet, but
when I glanced up at him I saw that his lips were set and his
eyes shining, with just a little flush upon each pale
cheek.&nbsp; There was no need to urge on the mares, for they
were already flying at a pace which could neither be stopped nor
controlled.&nbsp; Our leader&rsquo;s head came abreast of the off
hind wheel, then of the off front one&mdash;then for a hundred
yards we did not gain an inch, and then with a spurt the bay
leader was neck to neck with the black wheeler, and our fore
wheel within an inch of their hind one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dusty work!&rdquo; said my uncle, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fan &rsquo;em, Jack!&nbsp; Fan &rsquo;em!&rdquo;
shrieked the lady.</p>
<p>He sprang up and lashed at his horses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look out, Tregellis!&rdquo; he shouted.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a damnation spill coming for
somebody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had got fairly abreast of them now, the rumps of the horses
exactly a-line and the fore wheels whizzing together.&nbsp; There
was not six inches to spare in the breadth of the road, and every
instant I expected to feel the jar of a locking wheel.&nbsp; But
now, as we came out from the dust, we could see what was ahead,
and my uncle whistled between his teeth at the sight.</p>
<p>Two hundred yards or so in front of us there was a bridge,
with wooden posts and rails upon either side.&nbsp; The road
narrowed down at the point, so that it was obvious that the two
carriages abreast could not possibly get over.&nbsp; One must
give way to the other.&nbsp; Already our wheels were abreast of
their wheelers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I lead!&rdquo; shouted my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must
pull them, Lade!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I!&rdquo; he roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, by George!&rdquo; shrieked her ladyship.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Fan &rsquo;em, Jack; keep on fanning &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to me that we were all going to eternity
together.&nbsp; But my uncle did the only thing that could have
saved us.&nbsp; By a desperate effort we might just clear the
coach before reaching the mouth of the bridge.&nbsp; He sprang
up, and lashed right and left at the mares, who, maddened by the
unaccustomed pain, hurled themselves on in a frenzy.&nbsp; Down
we thundered together, all shouting, I believe, at the top of our
voices in the madness of the moment; but still we were drawing
steadily away, and we were almost clear of the leaders when we
flew on to the bridge.&nbsp; I glanced back at the coach, and I
saw Lady Lade, with her savage little white teeth clenched
together, throw herself forward and tug with both hands at the
off-side reins.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jam them, Jack!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jam
the&mdash;before they can pass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had she done it an instant sooner we should have crashed
against the wood-work, carried it away, and been hurled into the
deep gully below.&nbsp; As it was, it was not the powerful haunch
of the black leader which caught our wheel, but the forequarter,
which had not weight enough to turn us from our course.&nbsp; I
saw a red wet seam gape suddenly through the black hair, and next
instant we were flying alone down the road, whilst the
four-in-hand had halted, and Sir John and his lady were down in
the road together tending to the wounded horse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy now, my beauties!&rdquo; cried my uncle, settling
down into his seat again, and looking back over his
shoulder.&nbsp; &ldquo;I could not have believed that Sir John
Lade would have been guilty of such a trick as pulling that
leader across.&nbsp; I do not permit a <i>mauvaise
plaisanterie</i> of that sort.&nbsp; He shall hear from me
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was the lady,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>My uncle&rsquo;s brow cleared, and he began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was little Letty, was it?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I might have known it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s a touch of the
late lamented Sixteen-string Jack about the trick.&nbsp; Well, it
is only messages of another kind that I send to a lady, so
we&rsquo;ll just drive on our way, nephew, and thank our stars
that we bring whole bones over the Thames.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stopped at the Greyhound, at Croydon, where the two good
little mares were sponged and petted and fed, after which, at an
easier pace, we made our way through Norbury and Streatham.&nbsp;
At last the fields grew fewer and the walls longer.&nbsp; The
outlying villas closed up thicker and thicker, until their
shoulders met, and we were driving between a double line of
houses with garish shops at the corners, and such a stream of
traffic as I had never seen, roaring down the centre.&nbsp; Then
suddenly we were on a broad bridge with a dark coffee-brown river
flowing sulkily beneath it, and bluff-bowed barges drifting down
upon its bosom.&nbsp; To right and left stretched a broken,
irregular line of many-coloured houses winding along either bank
as far as I could see.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the House of Parliament, nephew,&rdquo;
said my uncle, pointing with his whip, &ldquo;and the black
towers are Westminster Abbey.&nbsp; How do, your Grace?&nbsp; How
do?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the Duke of Norfolk&mdash;the stout man in
blue upon the swish-tailed mare.&nbsp; Now we are in
Whitehall.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the Treasury on the left, and the
Horse Guards, and the Admiralty, where the stone dolphins are
carved above the gate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had the idea, which a country-bred lad brings up with him,
that London was merely a wilderness of houses, but I was
astonished now to see the green slopes and the lovely spring
trees showing between.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, those are the Privy Gardens,&rdquo; said my uncle,
&ldquo;and there is the window out of which Charles took his last
step on to the scaffold.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t think the mares
had come fifty miles, would you?&nbsp; See how <i>les petites
cheries</i> step out for the credit of their master.&nbsp; Look
at the barouche, with the sharp-featured man peeping out of the
window.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Pitt, going down to the House.&nbsp;
We are coming into Pall Mall now, and this great building on the
left is Carlton House, the Prince&rsquo;s Palace.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s St. James&rsquo;s, the big, dingy place with the
clock, and the two red-coated sentries before it.&nbsp; And
here&rsquo;s the famous street of the same name, nephew, which is
the very centre of the world, and here&rsquo;s Jermyn Street
opening out of it, and finally, here&rsquo;s my own little box,
and we are well under the five hours from Brighton Old
Square.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>CHAPTER IX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">WATIER&rsquo;S.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> uncle&rsquo;s house in Jermyn
Street was quite a small one&mdash;five rooms and an attic.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A man-cook and a cottage,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are all
that a wise man requires.&rdquo;&nbsp; On the other hand, it was
furnished with the neatness and taste which belonged to his
character, so that his most luxurious friends found something in
the tiny rooms which made them discontented with their own
sumptuous mansions.&nbsp; Even the attic, which had been
converted into my bedroom, was the most perfect little bijou
attic that could possibly be imagined.&nbsp; Beautiful and
valuable knick-knacks filled every corner of every apartment, and
the house had become a perfect miniature museum which would have
delighted a virtuoso.&nbsp; My uncle explained the presence of
all these pretty things with a shrug of his shoulders and a wave
of his hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are <i>des petites
cadeaux</i>,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but it would be an
indiscretion for me to say more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We found a note from Ambrose waiting for us which increased
rather than explained the mystery of his disappearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Sir Charles Tregellis,&rdquo; it ran, &ldquo;it
will ever be a subject of regret to me that the force of
circumstances should have compelled me to leave your service in
so abrupt a fashion, but something occurred during our journey
from Friar&rsquo;s Oak to Brighton which left me without any
possible alternative.&nbsp; I trust, however, that my absence may
prove to be but a temporary one.&nbsp; The isinglass recipe for
the shirt-fronts is in the strong-box at Drummond&rsquo;s
Bank.&mdash;Yours obediently, AMBROSE.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I must fill his place as best I
can,&rdquo; said my uncle, moodily.&nbsp; &ldquo;But how on earth
could something have occurred to make him leave me at a time when
we were going full-trot down hill in my curricle?&nbsp; I shall
never find his match again either for chocolate or cravats.&nbsp;
<i>Je suis desol&eacute;</i>!&nbsp; But now, nephew, we must send
to Weston and have you fitted up.&nbsp; It is not for a gentleman
to go to a shop, but for the shop to come to the gentleman.&nbsp;
Until you have your clothes you must remain <i>en
retraite</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The measuring was a most solemn and serious function, though
it was nothing to the trying-on two days later, when my uncle
stood by in an agony of apprehension as each garment was
adjusted, he and Weston arguing over every seam and lapel and
skirt until I was dizzy with turning round in front of
them.&nbsp; Then, just as I had hoped that all was settled, in
came young Mr. Brummell, who promised to be an even greater
exquisite than my uncle, and the whole matter had to be thrashed
out between them.&nbsp; He was a good-sized man, this Brummell,
with a long, fair face, light brown hair, and slight sandy
side-whiskers.&nbsp; His manner was languid, his voice drawling,
and while he eclipsed my uncle in the extravagance of his speech,
he had not the air of manliness and decision which underlay all
my kinsman&rsquo;s affectations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, George,&rdquo; cried my uncle, &ldquo;I thought
you were with your regiment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve sent in my papers,&rdquo; drawled the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it would come to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; The Tenth was ordered to Manchester, and
they could hardly expect me to go to a place like that.&nbsp;
Besides, I found the major monstrous rude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He expected me to know about his absurd drill,
Tregellis, and I had other things to think of, as you may
suppose.&nbsp; I had no difficulty in taking my right place on
parade, for there was a trooper with a red nose on a flea-bitten
grey, and I had observed that my post was always immediately in
front of him.&nbsp; This saved a great deal of trouble.&nbsp; The
other day, however, when I came on parade, I galloped up one line
and down the other, but the deuce a glimpse could I get of that
long nose of his!&nbsp; Then, just as I was at my wits&rsquo;
end, I caught sight of him, alone at one side; so I formed up in
front.&nbsp; It seems he had been put there to keep the ground,
and the major so far forgot himself as to say that I knew nothing
of my duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle laughed, and Brummell looked me up and down with his
large, intolerant eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These will do very passably,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Buff and blue are always very gentlemanlike.&nbsp; But a
sprigged waistcoat would have been better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said my uncle, warmly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Tregellis, you are infallible upon a cravat,
but you must allow me the right of my own judgment upon
vests.&nbsp; I like it vastly as it stands, but a touch of red
sprig would give it the finish that it needs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They argued with many examples and analogies for a good ten
minutes, revolving round me at the same time with their heads on
one side and their glasses to their eyes.&nbsp; It was a relief
to me when they at last agreed upon a compromise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not let anything I have said shake your faith
in Sir Charles&rsquo;s judgment, Mr. Stone,&rdquo; said Brummell,
very earnestly.</p>
<p>I assured him that I should not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were my nephew, I should expect you to follow my
taste.&nbsp; But you will cut a very good figure as it is.&nbsp;
I had a young cousin who came up to town last year with a
recommendation to my care.&nbsp; But he would take no
advice.&nbsp; At the end of the second week I met him coming down
St. James&rsquo;s Street in a snuff-coloured coat cut by a
country tailor.&nbsp; He bowed to me.&nbsp; Of course I knew what
was due to myself.&nbsp; I looked all round him, and there was an
end to his career in town.&nbsp; You are from the country, Mr.
Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Sussex, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sussex!&nbsp; Why, that is where I send my washing
to.&nbsp; There is an excellent clear-starcher living near
Hayward&rsquo;s Heath.&nbsp; I send my shirts two at a time, for
if you send more it excites the woman and diverts her
attention.&nbsp; I cannot abide anything but country
washing.&nbsp; But I should be vastly sorry to have to live
there.&nbsp; What can a man find to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t hunt, George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I do, it&rsquo;s a woman.&nbsp; But surely you
don&rsquo;t go to hounds, Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was out with the Belvoir last winter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Belvoir!&nbsp; Did you hear how I smoked
Rutland?&nbsp; The story has been in the clubs this month
past.&nbsp; I bet him that my bag would weigh more than
his.&nbsp; He got three and a half brace, but I shot his
liver-coloured pointer, so he had to pay.&nbsp; But as to
hunting, what amusement can there be in flying about among a
crowd of greasy, galloping farmers?&nbsp; Every man to his own
taste, but Brookes&rsquo;s window by day and a snug corner of the
macao table at Watier&rsquo;s by night, give me all I want for
mind and body.&nbsp; You heard how I plucked Montague the
brewer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been out of town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had eight thousand from him at a sitting.&nbsp;
&lsquo;I shall drink your beer in future, Mr. Brewer,&rsquo; said
I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Every blackguard in London does,&rsquo; said
he.&nbsp; It was monstrous impolite of him, but some people
cannot lose with grace.&nbsp; Well, I am going down to Clarges
Street to pay Jew King a little of my interest.&nbsp; Are you
bound that way?&nbsp; Well, good-bye, then!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll see
you and your young friend at the club or in the Mall, no
doubt,&rdquo; and he sauntered off upon his way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That young man is destined to take my place,&rdquo;
said my uncle, gravely, when Brummell had departed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is quite young and of no descent, but he has made his
way by his cool effrontery, his natural taste, and his
extravagance of speech.&nbsp; There is no man who can be impolite
in so polished a fashion.&nbsp; He has a half-smile, and a way of
raising his eyebrows, for which he will be shot one of these
mornings.&nbsp; Already his opinion is quoted in the clubs as a
rival to my own.&nbsp; Well, every man has his day, and when I am
convinced that mine is past, St. James&rsquo;s Street shall know
me no more, for it is not in my nature to be second to any
man.&nbsp; But now, nephew, in that buff and blue suit you may
pass anywhere; so, if you please, we will step into my
<i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, and I will show you something of the
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>How can I describe all that we saw and all that we did upon
that lovely spring day?&nbsp; To me it was as if I had been
wafted to a fairy world, and my uncle might have been some
benevolent enchanter in a high-collared, long-tailed coat, who
was guiding me about in it.&nbsp; He showed me the West-end
streets, with the bright carriages and the gaily dressed ladies
and sombre-clad men, all crossing and hurrying and recrossing
like an ants&rsquo; nest when you turn it over with a
stick.&nbsp; Never had I formed a conception of such endless
banks of houses, and such a ceaseless stream of life flowing
between.&nbsp; Then we passed down the Strand, where the crowd
was thicker than ever, and even penetrated beyond Temple Bar and
into the City, though my uncle begged me not to mention it, for
he would not wish it to be generally known.&nbsp; There I saw the
Exchange and the Bank and Lloyd&rsquo;s Coffee House, with the
brown-coated, sharp-faced merchants and the hurrying clerks, the
huge horses and the busy draymen.&nbsp; It was a very different
world this from that which we had left in the West&mdash;a world
of energy and of strength, where there was no place for the
listless and the idle.&nbsp; Young as I was, I knew that it was
here, in the forest of merchant shipping, in the bales which
swung up to the warehouse windows, in the loaded waggons which
roared over the cobblestones, that the power of Britain
lay.&nbsp; Here, in the City of London, was the taproot from
which Empire and wealth and so many other fine leaves had
sprouted.&nbsp; Fashion and speech and manners may change, but
the spirit of enterprise within that square mile or two of land
must not change, for when it withers all that has grown from it
must wither also.</p>
<p>We lunched at Stephen&rsquo;s, the fashionable inn in Bond
Street, where I saw a line of tilburys and saddle-horses, which
stretched from the door to the further end of the street.&nbsp;
And thence we went to the Mail in St. James&rsquo;s Park, and
thence to Brookes&rsquo;s, the great Whig club, and thence again
to Watier&rsquo;s, where the men of fashion used to gamble.&nbsp;
Everywhere I met the same sort of men, with their stiff figures
and small waists, all showing the utmost deference to my uncle,
and for his sake an easy tolerance of me.&nbsp; The talk was
always such as I had already heard at the Pavilion: talk of
politics, talk of the King&rsquo;s health, talk of the
Prince&rsquo;s extravagance, of the expected renewal of war, of
horse-racing, and of the ring.&nbsp; I saw, too, that
eccentricity was, as my uncle had told me, the fashion; and if
the folk upon the Continent look upon us even to this day as
being a nation of lunatics, it is no doubt a tradition handed
down from the time when the only travellers whom they were likely
to see were drawn from the class which I was now meeting.</p>
<p>It was an age of heroism and of folly.&nbsp; On the one hand
soldiers, sailors, and statesmen of the quality of Pitt, Nelson,
and afterwards Wellington, had been forced to the front by the
imminent menace of Buonaparte.&nbsp; We were great in arms, and
were soon also to be great in literature, for Scott and Byron
were in their day the strongest forces in Europe.&nbsp; On the
other hand, a touch of madness, real or assumed, was a passport
through doors which were closed to wisdom and to virtue.&nbsp;
The man who could enter a drawing-room walking upon his hands,
the man who had filed his teeth that he might whistle like a
coachman, the man who always spoke his thoughts aloud and so kept
his guests in a quiver of apprehension, these were the people who
found it easy to come to the front in London society.&nbsp; Nor
could the heroism and the folly be kept apart, for there were few
who could quite escape the contagion of the times.&nbsp; In an
age when the Premier was a heavy drinker, the Leader of the
Opposition a libertine, and the Prince of Wales a combination of
the two, it was hard to know where to look for a man whose
private and public characters were equally lofty.&nbsp; At the
same time, with all its faults it was a <i>strong</i> age, and
you will be fortunate if in your time the country produces five
such names as Pitt, Fox, Scott, Nelson, and Wellington.</p>
<p>It was in Watier&rsquo;s that night, seated by my uncle on one
of the red velvet settees at the side of the room, that I had
pointed out to me some of those singular characters whose fame
and eccentricities are even now not wholly forgotten in the
world.&nbsp; The long, many-pillared room, with its mirrors and
chandeliers, was crowded with full-blooded, loud-voiced
men-about-town, all in the same dark evening dress with white
silk stockings, cambric shirt-fronts, and little, flat
chapeau-bras under their arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The acid-faced old gentleman with the thin legs is the
Marquis of Queensberry,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;His
chaise was driven nineteen miles in an hour in a match against
the Count Taafe, and he sent a message fifty miles in thirty
minutes by throwing it from hand to hand in a cricket-ball.&nbsp;
The man he is talking to is Sir Charles Bunbury, of the Jockey
Club, who had the Prince warned off the Heath at Newmarket on
account of the in-and-out riding of Sam Chifney, his
jockey.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Captain Barclay going up to them
now.&nbsp; He knows more about training than any man alive, and
he has walked ninety miles in twenty-one hours.&nbsp; You have
only to look at his calves to see that Nature built him for
it.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s another walker there, the man with a
flowered vest standing near the fireplace.&nbsp; That is Buck
Whalley, who walked to Jerusalem in a long blue coat, top-boots,
and buckskins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he do that, sir?&rdquo; I asked, in
astonishment.</p>
<p>My uncle shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was his humour,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
walked into society through it, and that was better worth
reaching than Jerusalem.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Lord Petersham, the
man with the beaky nose.&nbsp; He always rises at six in the
evening, and he has laid down the finest cellar of snuff in
Europe.&nbsp; It was he who ordered his valet to put half a dozen
of sherry by his bed and call him the day after to-morrow.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s talking to Lord Panmure, who can take his six bottles
of claret and argue with a bishop after it.&nbsp; The lean man
with the weak knees is General Scott who lives upon toast and
water and has won &pound;200,000 at whist.&nbsp; He is talking to
young Lord Blandford who gave &pound;1800 for a Boccaccio the
other day.&nbsp; Evening, Dudley!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evening, Tregellis!&rdquo;&nbsp; An elderly,
vacant-looking man had stopped before us and was looking me up
and down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some young cub Charlie Tregellis has caught in the
country,&rdquo; he murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t look
as if he would be much credit to him.&nbsp; Been out of town,
Tregellis?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a few days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&rdquo; said the man, transferring his sleepy gaze
to my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s looking pretty bad.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;ll be going into the country feet foremost some of these
days if he doesn&rsquo;t pull up!&rdquo;&nbsp; He nodded, and
passed on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t look so mortified, nephew,&rdquo;
said my uncle, smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s old Lord
Dudley, and he has a trick of thinking aloud.&nbsp; People used
to be offended, but they take no notice of him now.&nbsp; It was
only last week, when he was dining at Lord Elgin&rsquo;s, that he
apologized to the company for the shocking bad cooking.&nbsp; He
thought he was at his own table, you see.&nbsp; It gives him a
place of his own in society.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Lord Harewood he
has fastened on to now.&nbsp; Harewood&rsquo;s peculiarity is to
mimic the Prince in everything.&nbsp; One day the Prince hid his
queue behind the collar of his coat, so Harewood cut his off,
thinking that they were going out of fashion.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
Lumley, the ugly man.&nbsp; &lsquo;<i>L&rsquo;homme
laid</i>&rsquo; they called him in Paris.&nbsp; The other one is
Lord Foley&mdash;they call him No. 11, on account of his thin
legs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is Mr. Brummell, sir,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he&rsquo;ll come to us presently.&nbsp; That young
man has certainly a future before him.&nbsp; Do you observe the
way in which he looks round the room from under his drooping
eyelids, as though it were a condescension that he should have
entered it?&nbsp; Small conceits are intolerable, but when they
are pushed to the uttermost they become respectable.&nbsp; How
do, George?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you heard about Vereker Merton?&rdquo; asked
Brummell, strolling up with one or two other exquisites at his
heels.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has run away with his father&rsquo;s
woman-cook, and actually married her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did Lord Merton do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He congratulated him warmly, and confessed that he had
always underrated his intelligence.&nbsp; He is to live with the
young couple, and make a handsome allowance on condition that the
bride sticks to her old duties.&nbsp; By the way, there was a
rumour that you were about to marry, Tregellis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; answered my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
would be a mistake to overwhelm one by attentions which are a
pleasure to many.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My view, exactly, and very neatly expressed,&rdquo;
cried Brummell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it fair to break a dozen hearts
in order to intoxicate one with rapture?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m off to
the Continent next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bailiffs?&rdquo; asked one of his companions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too bad, Pierrepoint.&nbsp; No, no; it is pleasure and
instruction combined.&nbsp; Besides, it is necessary to go to
Paris for your little things, and if there is a chance of the war
breaking out again, it would be well to lay in a
supply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right,&rdquo; said my uncle, who seemed to have
made up his mind to outdo Brummell in extravagance.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I used to get my sulphur-coloured gloves from the Palais
Royal.&nbsp; When the war broke out in &rsquo;93 I was cut off
from them for nine years.&nbsp; Had it not been for a lugger
which I specially hired to smuggle them, I might have been
reduced to English tan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The English are excellent at a flat-iron or a kitchen
poker, but anything more delicate is beyond them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our tailors are good,&rdquo; cried my uncle, &ldquo;but
our stuffs lack taste and variety.&nbsp; The war has made us more
<i>rococo</i> than ever.&nbsp; It has cut us off from travel, and
there is nothing to match travel for expanding the mind.&nbsp;
Last year, for example, I came upon some new waist-coating in the
Square of San Marco, at Venice.&nbsp; It was yellow, with the
prettiest little twill of pink running through it.&nbsp; How
could I have seen it had I not travelled?&nbsp; I brought it back
with me, and for a time it was all the rage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Prince took it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he usually follows my lead.&nbsp; We dressed so
alike last year that we were frequently mistaken for each
other.&nbsp; It tells against me, but so it was.&nbsp; He often
complains that things do not look as well upon him as upon me,
but how can I make the obvious reply?&nbsp; By the way, George, I
did not see you at the Marchioness of Dover&rsquo;s
ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was there, and lingered for a quarter of an hour
or so.&nbsp; I am surprised that you did not see me.&nbsp; I did
not go past the doorway, however, for undue preference gives rise
to jealousy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went early,&rdquo; said my uncle, &ldquo;for I had
heard that there were to be some tolerable
<i>d&eacute;butantes</i>.&nbsp; It always pleases me vastly when
I am able to pass a compliment to any of them.&nbsp; It has
happened, but not often, for I keep to my own
standard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they talked, these singular men, and I, looking from one to
the other, could not imagine how they could help bursting out
a-laughing in each other&rsquo;s faces.&nbsp; But, on the
contrary, their conversation was very grave, and filled out with
many little bows, and opening and shutting of snuff-boxes, and
flickings of laced handkerchiefs.&nbsp; Quite a crowd had
gathered silently around, and I could see that the talk had been
regarded as a contest between two men who were looked upon as
rival arbiters of fashion.&nbsp; It was finished by the Marquis
of Queensberry passing his arm through Brummell&rsquo;s and
leading him off, while my uncle threw out his laced cambric
shirt-front and shot his ruffles as if he were well satisfied
with his share in the encounter.&nbsp; It is seven-and-forty
years since I looked upon that circle of dandies, and where, now,
are their dainty little hats, their wonderful waistcoats, and
their boots, in which one could arrange one&rsquo;s cravat?&nbsp;
They lived strange lives, these men, and they died strange
deaths&mdash;some by their own hands, some as beggars, some in a
debtor&rsquo;s gaol, some, like the most brilliant of them all,
in a madhouse in a foreign land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is the card-room, Rodney,&rdquo; said my uncle,
as we passed an open door on our way out.&nbsp; Glancing in, I
saw a line of little green baize tables with small groups of men
sitting round, while at one side was a longer one, from which
there came a continuous murmur of voices.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may
lose what you like in there, save only your nerve or your
temper,&rdquo; my uncle continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, Sir Lothian,
I trust that the luck was with you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tall, thin man, with a hard, austere face, had stepped out
of the open doorway.&nbsp; His heavily thatched eyebrows covered
quick, furtive grey eyes, and his gaunt features were hollowed at
the cheek and temple like water-grooved flint.&nbsp; He was
dressed entirely in black, and I noticed that his shoulders
swayed a little as if he had been drinking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lost like the deuce,&rdquo; he snapped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, whist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t get very hard hit over
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he snarled.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Play a hundred a trick and a thousand on the rub, losing
steadily for five hours, and see what you think of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle was evidently struck by the haggard look upon the
other&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope it&rsquo;s not very bad,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad enough.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t bear talking
about.&nbsp; By the way, Tregellis, have you got your man for
this fight yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to be hanging in the wind a long time.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s play or pay, you know.&nbsp; I shall claim forfeit if
you don&rsquo;t come to scratch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will name your day I shall produce my man, Sir
Lothian,&rdquo; said my uncle, coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This day four weeks, if you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good.&nbsp; The 18th of May.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to have changed my name by then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that?&rdquo; asked my uncle, in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just possible that I may be Lord Avon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you have had some news?&rdquo; cried my uncle,
and I noticed a tremor in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had my agent over at Monte Video, and he
believes he has proof that Avon died there.&nbsp; Anyhow, it is
absurd to suppose that because a murderer chooses to fly from
justice&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t have you use that word, Sir
Lothian,&rdquo; cried my uncle, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were there as I was.&nbsp; You know that he was a
murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you that you shall not say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Lothian&rsquo;s fierce little grey eyes had to lower
themselves before the imperious anger which shone in my
uncle&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, to let that point pass, it is monstrous to
suppose that the title and the estates can remain hung up in this
way for ever.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m the heir, Tregellis, and I&rsquo;m
going to have my rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am, as you are aware, Lord Avon&rsquo;s dearest
friend,&rdquo; said my uncle, sternly.&nbsp; &ldquo;His
disappearance has not affected my love for him, and until his
fate is finally ascertained, I shall exert myself to see that
<i>his</i> rights also are respected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His rights would be a long drop and a cracked
spine,&rdquo; Sir Lothian answered, and then, changing his manner
suddenly, he laid his hand upon my uncle&rsquo;s sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, Tregellis, I was his friend as well as
you,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we cannot alter the facts,
and it is rather late in the day for us to fall out over
them.&nbsp; Your invitation holds good for Friday
night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall bring Crab Wilson with me, and finally arrange
the conditions of our little wager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Sir Lothian: I shall hope to see
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; They bowed, and my uncle stood a little time
looking after him as he made his way amidst the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good sportsman, nephew,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A bold rider, the best pistol-shot in England, but . . . a
dangerous man!&rdquo;</p>

153</span>CHAPTER X.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE MEN OF THE RING.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was at the end of my first week
in London that my uncle gave a supper to the fancy, as was usual
for gentlemen of that time if they wished to figure before the
public as Corinthians and patrons of sport.&nbsp; He had invited
not only the chief fighting-men of the day, but also those men of
fashion who were most interested in the ring: Mr. Fletcher Reid,
Lord Say and Sele, Sir Lothian Hume, Sir John Lade, Colonel
Montgomery, Sir Thomas Apreece, the Hon. Berkeley Craven, and
many more.&nbsp; The rumour that the Prince was to be present had
already spread through the clubs, and invitations were eagerly
sought after.</p>
<p>The Waggon and Horses was a well-known sporting house, with an
old prize-fighter for landlord.&nbsp; And the arrangements were
as primitive as the most Bohemian could wish.&nbsp; It was one of
the many curious fashions which have now died out, that men who
were <i>blas&eacute;</i> from luxury and high living seemed to
find a fresh piquancy in life by descending to the lowest
resorts, so that the night-houses and gambling-dens in Covent
Garden or the Haymarket often gathered illustrious company under
their smoke-blackened ceilings.&nbsp; It was a change for them to
turn their backs upon the cooking of Weltjie and of Ude, or the
chambertin of old Q., and to dine upon a porter-house steak
washed down by a pint of ale from a pewter pot.</p>
<p>A rough crowd had assembled in the street to see the
fighting-men go in, and my uncle warned me to look to my pockets
as we pushed our way through it.&nbsp; Within was a large room
with faded red curtains, a sanded floor, and walls which were
covered with prints of pugilists and race-horses.&nbsp; Brown
liquor-stained tables were dotted about in it, and round one of
these half a dozen formidable-looking men were seated, while one,
the roughest of all, was perched upon the table itself, swinging
his legs to and fro.&nbsp; A tray of small glasses and pewter
mugs stood beside them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boys were thirsty, sir, so I brought up some ale
and some liptrap,&rdquo; whispered the landlord; &ldquo;I thought
you would have no objection, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite right, Bob!&nbsp; How are you all?&nbsp; How are
you, Maddox?&nbsp; How are you, Baldwin?&nbsp; Ah, Belcher, I am
very glad to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fighting-men rose and took their hats off, except the
fellow on the table, who continued to swing his legs and to look
my uncle very coolly in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, Berks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty tidy.&nbsp; &rsquo;Ow are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say &lsquo;sir&rsquo; when you speak to a
genelman,&rdquo; said Belcher, and with a sudden tilt of the
table he sent Berks flying almost into my uncle&rsquo;s arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See now, Jem, none o&rsquo; that!&rdquo; said Berks,
sulkily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll learn you manners, Joe, which is more than
ever your father did.&nbsp; You&rsquo;re not drinkin&rsquo;
black-jack in a boozin&rsquo; ken, but you are meetin&rsquo;
noble, slap-up Corinthians, and it&rsquo;s for you to behave as
such.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve always been reckoned a genelman-like sort of
man,&rdquo; said Berks, thickly, &ldquo;but if so be as
I&rsquo;ve said or done what I &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t ought
to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, there, Berks, that&rsquo;s all right!&rdquo;
cried my uncle, only too anxious to smooth things over and to
prevent a quarrel at the outset of the evening.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here
are some more of our friends.&nbsp; How are you, Apreece?&nbsp;
How are you, Colonel?&nbsp; Well, Jackson, you are looking vastly
better.&nbsp; Good evening, Lade.&nbsp; I trust Lady Lade was
none the worse for our pleasant drive.&nbsp; Ah, Mendoza, you
look fit enough to throw your hat over the ropes this
instant.&nbsp; Sir Lothian, I am glad to see you.&nbsp; You will
find some old friends here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Amid the stream of Corinthians and fighting-men who were
thronging into the room I had caught a glimpse of the sturdy
figure and broad, good-humoured face of Champion Harrison.&nbsp;
The sight of him was like a whiff of South Down air coming into
that low-roofed, oil-smelling room, and I ran forward to shake
him by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Master Rodney&mdash;or I should say Mr. Stone, I
suppose&mdash;you&rsquo;ve changed out of all knowledge.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t hardly believe that it was really you that used to
come down to blow the bellows when Boy Jim and I were at the
anvil.&nbsp; Well, you are fine, to be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the news of Friar&rsquo;s Oak?&rdquo; I
asked eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father was down to chat with me, Master Rodney,
and he tells me that the war is going to break out again, and
that he hopes to see you here in London before many days are
past; for he is coming up to see Lord Nelson and to make inquiry
about a ship.&nbsp; Your mother is well, and I saw her in church
on Sunday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Boy Jim?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Champion Harrison&rsquo;s good-humoured face clouded over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;d set his heart very much on comin&rsquo; here
to-night, but there were reasons why I didn&rsquo;t wish him to,
and so there&rsquo;s a shadow betwixt us.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the
first that ever was, and I feel it, Master Rodney.&nbsp; Between
ourselves, I have very good reason to wish him to stay with me,
and I am sure that, with his high spirit and his ideas, he would
never settle down again after once he had a taste o&rsquo;
London.&nbsp; I left him behind me with enough work to keep him
busy until I get back to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A tall and beautifully proportioned man, very elegantly
dressed, was strolling towards us.&nbsp; He stared in surprise
and held out his hand to my companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Jack Harrison!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
is a resurrection.&nbsp; Where in the world did you come
from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Glad to see you, Jackson,&rdquo; said my
companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;You look as well and as young as
ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, yes.&nbsp; I resigned the belt when I could
get no one to fight me for it, and I took to teaching.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m doing smith&rsquo;s work down Sussex
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered why you never had a shy at my
belt.&nbsp; I tell you honestly, between man and man, I&rsquo;m
very glad you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s real good of you to say that,
Jackson.&nbsp; I might ha&rsquo; done it, perhaps, but the old
woman was against it.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s been a good wife to me
and I can&rsquo;t go against her.&nbsp; But I feel a bit lonesome
here, for these boys are since my time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You could do some of them over now,&rdquo; said
Jackson, feeling my friend&rsquo;s upper arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;No
better bit of stuff was ever seen in a twenty-four foot
ring.&nbsp; It would be a rare treat to see you take some of
these young ones on.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you let me spring you on
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harrison&rsquo;s eyes glistened at the idea, but he shook his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t do, Jackson.&nbsp; My old woman holds my
promise.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s Belcher, ain&rsquo;t it&mdash;the
good lookin&rsquo; young chap with the flash coat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s Jem.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve not seen
him!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a jewel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard.&nbsp; Who&rsquo;s the youngster
beside him?&nbsp; He looks a tidy chap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a new man from the West.&nbsp; Crab
Wilson&rsquo;s his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harrison looked at him with interest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
heard of him,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are getting a
match on for him, ain&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Sir Lothian Hume, the thin-faced gentleman
over yonder, has backed him against Sir Charles Tregellis&rsquo;s
man.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re to hear about the match to-night, I
understand.&nbsp; Jem Belcher thinks great things of Crab
Wilson.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Belcher&rsquo;s young brother,
Tom.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s looking out for a match, too.&nbsp; They
say he&rsquo;s quicker than Jem with the mufflers, but he
can&rsquo;t hit as hard.&nbsp; I was speaking of your brother,
Jem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young &rsquo;un will make his way,&rdquo; said
Belcher, who had come across to us.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s more
a sparrer than a fighter just at present, but when his gristle
sets he&rsquo;ll take on anything on the list.&nbsp;
Bristol&rsquo;s as full o&rsquo; young fightin&rsquo;-men now as
a bin is of bottles.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve got two more comin&rsquo;
up&mdash;Gully and Pearce&mdash;who&rsquo;ll make you London
milling coves wish they was back in the west country
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the Prince,&rdquo; said Jackson, as a hum
and bustle rose from the door.</p>
<p>I saw George come bustling in, with a good-humoured smile upon
his comely face.&nbsp; My uncle welcomed him, and led some of the
Corinthians up to be presented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have trouble, gov&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; said
Belcher to Jackson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Joe Berks
drinkin&rsquo; gin out of a mug, and you know what a swine he is
when he&rsquo;s drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must put a stopper on &rsquo;im
gov&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; said several of the other
prize-fighters.&nbsp; &ldquo;&rsquo;E ain&rsquo;t what
you&rsquo;d call a charmer when &rsquo;e&rsquo;s sober, but
there&rsquo;s no standing &rsquo;im when &rsquo;e&rsquo;s
fresh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson, on account of his prowess and of the tact which he
possessed, had been chosen as general regulator of the whole
prize-fighting body, by whom he was usually alluded to as the
Commander-in-Chief.&nbsp; He and Belcher went across now to the
table upon which Berks was still perched.&nbsp; The
ruffian&rsquo;s face was already flushed, and his eyes heavy and
bloodshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must keep yourself in hand to-night, Berks,&rdquo;
said Jackson.&nbsp; &ldquo;The Prince is here,
and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never set eyes on &rsquo;im yet,&rdquo; cried Berks,
lurching off the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is &rsquo;e,
gov&rsquo;nor?&nbsp; Tell &rsquo;im Joe Berks would like to do
&rsquo;isself proud by shakin&rsquo; &rsquo;im by the
&rsquo;and.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you don&rsquo;t, Joe,&rdquo; said Jackson, laying
his hand upon Berks&rsquo;s chest, as he tried to push his way
through the crowd.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got to keep your
place, Joe, or we&rsquo;ll put you where you can make all the
noise you like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s that, gov&rsquo;nor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Into the street, through the window.&nbsp; We&rsquo;re
going to have a peaceful evening, as Jem Belcher and I will show
you if you get up to any of your Whitechapel games.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No &rsquo;arm, gov&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; grumbled
Berks.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ve always &rsquo;ad
the name of bein&rsquo; a very genelman-like man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve always said, Joe Berks, and mind you
prove yourself such.&nbsp; But the supper is ready for us, and
there&rsquo;s the Prince and Lord Sole going in.&nbsp; Two and
two, lads, and don&rsquo;t forget whose company you are
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The supper was laid in a large room, with Union Jacks and
mottoes hung thickly upon the walls.&nbsp; The tables were
arranged in three sides of a square, my uncle occupying the
centre of the principal one, with the Prince upon his right and
Lord Sele upon his left.&nbsp; By his wise precaution the seats
had been allotted beforehand, so that the gentlemen might be
scattered among the professionals and no risk run of two enemies
finding themselves together, or a man who had been recently
beaten falling into the company of his conqueror.&nbsp; For my
own part, I had Champion Harrison upon one side of me and a
stout, florid-faced man upon the other, who whispered to me that
he was &ldquo;Bill Warr, landlord of the One Tun public-house, of
Jermyn Street, and one of the gamest men upon the
list.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my flesh that&rsquo;s beat me, sir,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;It creeps over me amazin&rsquo; fast.&nbsp;
I should fight at thirteen-eight, and &rsquo;ere I am nearly
seventeen.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the business that does it, what with
loflin&rsquo; about behind the bar all day, and bein&rsquo;
afraid to refuse a wet for fear of offendin&rsquo; a
customer.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s been the ruin of many a good
fightin&rsquo;-man before me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should take to my job,&rdquo; said Harrison.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a smith by trade, and I&rsquo;ve not put on half
a stone in fifteen years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some take to one thing and some to another, but the
most of us try to &rsquo;ave a bar-parlour of our own.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s Will Wood, that I beat in forty rounds in the thick
of a snowstorm down Navestock way, &rsquo;e drives a
&rsquo;ackney.&nbsp; Young Firby, the ruffian, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s a
waiter now.&nbsp; Dick &rsquo;Umphries sells coals&mdash;&rsquo;e
was always of a genelmanly disposition.&nbsp; George Ingleston is
a brewer&rsquo;s drayman.&nbsp; We all find our own cribs.&nbsp;
But there&rsquo;s one thing you are saved by livin&rsquo; in the
country, and that is &rsquo;avin&rsquo; the young Corinthians and
bloods about town smackin&rsquo; you eternally in the
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was the last inconvenience which I should have expected a
famous prize-fighter to be subjected to, but several bull-faced
fellows at the other side of the table nodded their
concurrence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right, Bill,&rdquo; said one of
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no one has had more trouble with
them than I have.&nbsp; In they come of an evenin&rsquo; into my
bar, with the wine in their heads.&nbsp; &lsquo;Are you Tom Owen
the bruiser?&rsquo; says one o&rsquo; them.&nbsp; &lsquo;At your
service, sir,&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; &lsquo;Take that, then,&rsquo;
says he, and it&rsquo;s a clip on the nose, or a backhanded slap
across the chops as likely as not.&nbsp; Then they can brag all
their lives that they had hit Tom Owen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;D&rsquo;you draw their cork in return?&rdquo; asked
Harrison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I argey it out with them.&nbsp; I say to them,
&lsquo;Now, gents, fightin&rsquo; is my profession, and I
don&rsquo;t fight for love any more than a doctor doctors for
love, or a butcher gives away a loin chop.&nbsp; Put up a small
purse, master, and I&rsquo;ll do you over and proud.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t expect that you&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to come here and
get glutted by a middle-weight champion for nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my way too, Tom,&rdquo; said my burly
neighbour.&nbsp; &ldquo;If they put down a guinea on the
counter&mdash;which they do if they &rsquo;ave been
drinkin&rsquo; very &rsquo;eavy&mdash;I give them what I think is
about a guinea&rsquo;s worth and take the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if they don&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, then, it&rsquo;s a common assault, d&rsquo;ye see,
against the body of &rsquo;is Majesty&rsquo;s liege, William
Warr, and I &rsquo;as &rsquo;em before the beak next
mornin&rsquo;, and it&rsquo;s a week or twenty
shillin&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile the supper was in full swing&mdash;one of those
solid and uncompromising meals which prevailed in the days of
your grandfathers, and which may explain to some of you why you
never set eyes upon that relative.</p>
<p>Great rounds of beef, saddles of mutton, smoking tongues, veal
and ham pies, turkeys and chickens, and geese, with every variety
of vegetables, and a succession of fiery cherries and heavy ales
were the main staple of the feast.&nbsp; It was the same meal and
the same cooking as their Norse or German ancestors might have
sat down to fourteen centuries before, and, indeed, as I looked
through the steam of the dishes at the lines of fierce and rugged
faces, and the mighty shoulders which rounded themselves over the
board, I could have imagined myself at one of those old-world
carousals of which I had read, where the savage company gnawed
the joints to the bone, and then, with murderous horseplay,
hurled the remains at their prisoners.&nbsp; Here and there the
pale, aquiline features of a sporting Corinthian recalled rather
the Norman type, but in the main these stolid, heavy-jowled
faces, belonging to men whose whole life was a battle, were the
nearest suggestion which we have had in modern times of those
fierce pirates and rovers from whose loins we have sprung.</p>
<p>And yet, as I looked carefully from man to man in the line
which faced me, I could see that the English, although they were
ten to one, had not the game entirely to themselves, but that
other races had shown that they could produce fighting-men worthy
to rank with the best.</p>
<p>There were, it is true, no finer or braver men in the room
than Jackson and Jem Belcher, the one with his magnificent
figure, his small waist and Herculean shoulders; the other as
graceful as an old Grecian statue, with a head whose beauty many
a sculptor had wished to copy, and with those long, delicate
lines in shoulder and loins and limbs, which gave him the
litheness and activity of a panther.&nbsp; Already, as I looked
at him, it seemed to me that there was a shadow of tragedy upon
his face, a forecast of the day then but a few months distant
when a blow from a racquet ball darkened the sight of one eye for
ever.&nbsp; Had he stopped there, with his unbeaten career behind
him, then indeed the evening of his life might have been as
glorious as its dawn.&nbsp; But his proud heart could not permit
his title to be torn from him without a struggle.&nbsp; If even
now you can read how the gallant fellow, unable with his one eye
to judge his distances, fought for thirty-five minutes against
his young and formidable opponent, and how, in the bitterness of
defeat, he was heard only to express his sorrow for a friend who
had backed him with all he possessed, and if you are not touched
by the story there must be something wanting in you which should
go to the making of a man.</p>
<p>But if there were no men at the tables who could have held
their own against Jackson or Jem Belcher, there were others of a
different race and type who had qualities which made them
dangerous bruisers.&nbsp; A little way down the room I saw the
black face and woolly head of Bill Richmond, in a purple-and-gold
footman&rsquo;s livery&mdash;destined to be the predecessor of
Molineaux, Sutton, and all that line of black boxers who have
shown that the muscular power and insensibility to pain which
distinguish the African give him a peculiar advantage in the
sports of the ring.&nbsp; He could boast also of the higher
honour of having been the first born American to win laurels in
the British ring.&nbsp; There also I saw the keen features of
Dada Mendoza, the Jew, just retired from active work, and leaving
behind him a reputation for elegance and perfect science which
has, to this day, never been exceeded.&nbsp; The worst fault that
the critics could find with him was that there was a want of
power in his blows&mdash;a remark which certainly could not have
been made about his neighbour, whose long face, curved nose, and
dark, flashing eyes proclaimed him as a member of the same
ancient race.&nbsp; This was the formidable Dutch Sam, who fought
at nine stone six, and yet possessed such hitting powers, that
his admirers, in after years, were willing to back him against
the fourteen-stone Tom Cribb, if each were strapped a-straddle to
a bench.&nbsp; Half a dozen other sallow Hebrew faces showed how
energetically the Jews of Houndsditch and Whitechapel had taken
to the sport of the land of their adoption, and that in this, as
in more serious fields of human effort, they could hold their own
with the best.</p>
<p>It was my neighbour Warr who very good-humouredly pointed out
to me all these celebrities, the echoes of whose fame had been
wafted down even to our little Sussex village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Andrew Gamble, the Irish champion,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was &rsquo;e that beat Noah James, the
Guardsman, and was afterwards nearly killed by Jem Belcher, in
the &rsquo;ollow of Wimbledon Common by Abbershaw&rsquo;s
gibbet.&nbsp; The two that are next &rsquo;im are Irish also,
Jack O&rsquo;Donnell and Bill Ryan.&nbsp; When you get a good
Irishman you can&rsquo;t better &rsquo;em, but they&rsquo;re
dreadful &rsquo;asty.&nbsp; That little cove with the leery face
is Caleb Baldwin the Coster, &rsquo;im that they call the Pride
of Westminster.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;s but five foot seven, and
nine stone five, but &rsquo;e&rsquo;s got the &rsquo;eart of a
giant.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;s never been beat, and there
ain&rsquo;t a man within a stone of &rsquo;im that could beat
&rsquo;im, except only Dutch Sam.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s George
Maddox, too, another o&rsquo; the same breed, and as good a man
as ever pulled his coat off.&nbsp; The genelmanly man that eats
with a fork, &rsquo;im what looks like a Corinthian, only that
the bridge of &rsquo;is nose ain&rsquo;t quite as it ought to be,
that&rsquo;s Dick &rsquo;Umphries, the same that was cock of the
middle-weights until Mendoza cut his comb for &rsquo;im.&nbsp;
You see the other with the grey &rsquo;ead and the scars on his
face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s old Tom Faulkner the cricketer!&rdquo;
cried Harrison, following the line of Bill Warr&rsquo;s stubby
forefinger.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the fastest bowler in the
Midlands, and at his best there weren&rsquo;t many boxers in
England that could stand up against him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right there, Jack &rsquo;Arrison.&nbsp;
&rsquo;E was one of the three who came up to fight when the best
men of Birmingham challenged the best men of London.&nbsp;
&rsquo;E&rsquo;s an evergreen, is Tom.&nbsp; Why, he was turned
five-and-fifty when he challenged and beat, after fifty minutes
of it, Jack Thornhill, who was tough enough to take it out of
many a youngster.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s better to give odds in weight
than in years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Youth will be served,&rdquo; said a crooning voice from
the other side of the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay, masters, youth will
be served.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man who had spoken was the most extraordinary of all the
many curious figures in the room.&nbsp; He was very, very old, so
old that he was past all comparison, and no one by looking at his
mummy skin and fish-like eyes could give a guess at his
years.&nbsp; A few scanty grey hairs still hung about his yellow
scalp.&nbsp; As to his features, they were scarcely human in
their disfigurement, for the deep wrinkles and pouchings of
extreme age had been added to a face which had always been
grotesquely ugly, and had been crushed and smashed in addition by
many a blow.&nbsp; I had noticed this creature at the beginning
of the meal, leaning his chest against the edge of the table as
if its support was a welcome one, and feebly picking at the food
which was placed before him.&nbsp; Gradually, however, as his
neighbours plied him with drink, his shoulders grew squarer, his
back stiffened, his eyes brightened, and he looked about him,
with an air of surprise at first, as if he had no clear
recollection of how he came there, and afterwards with an
expression of deepening interest, as he listened, with his ear
scooped up in his hand, to the conversation around him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s old Buckhorse,&rdquo; whispered Champion
Harrison.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was just the same as that when I joined
the ring twenty years ago.&nbsp; Time was when he was the terror
of London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E was so,&rdquo; said Bill Warr.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;E would fight like a stag, and &rsquo;e was that
&rsquo;ard that &rsquo;e would let any swell knock &rsquo;im down
for &rsquo;alf-a-crown.&nbsp; &rsquo;E &rsquo;ad no face to
spoil, d&rsquo;ye see, for &rsquo;e was always the ugliest man in
England.&nbsp; But &rsquo;e&rsquo;s been on the shelf now for
near sixty years, and it cost &rsquo;im many a beatin&rsquo;
before &rsquo;e could understand that &rsquo;is strength was
slippin&rsquo; away from &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Youth will be served, masters,&rdquo; droned the old
man, shaking his head miserably.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fill up &rsquo;is glass,&rdquo; said Warr.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, Tom, give old Buckhorse a sup o&rsquo;
liptrap.&nbsp; Warm his &rsquo;eart for &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man poured a glass of neat gin down his shrivelled
throat, and the effect upon him was extraordinary.&nbsp; A light
glimmered in each of his dull eyes, a tinge of colour came into
his wax-like cheeks, and, opening his toothless mouth, he
suddenly emitted a peculiar, bell-like, and most musical
cry.&nbsp; A hoarse roar of laughter from all the company
answered it, and flushed faces craned over each other to catch a
glimpse of the veteran.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Buckhorse!&rdquo; they cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Buckhorse is comin&rsquo; round again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can laugh if you vill, masters,&rdquo; he cried, in
his Lewkner Lane dialect, holding up his two thin, vein-covered
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;It von&rsquo;t be long that you&rsquo;ll be
able to see my crooks vich &rsquo;ave been on Figg&rsquo;s conk,
and on Jack Broughton&rsquo;s, and on &rsquo;Arry Gray&rsquo;s,
and many another good fightin&rsquo; man that was millin&rsquo;
for a livin&rsquo; before your fathers could eat pap.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company laughed again, and encouraged the old man by
half-derisive and half-affectionate cries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let &rsquo;em &rsquo;ave it, Buckhorse!&nbsp; Give it
&rsquo;em straight!&nbsp; Tell us how the millin&rsquo; coves did
it in your time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old gladiator looked round him in great contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vy, from vot I see,&rdquo; he cried, in his high,
broken treble, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s some on you that ain&rsquo;t
fit to flick a fly from a joint o&rsquo; meat.&nbsp; You&rsquo;d
make werry good ladies&rsquo; maids, the most of you, but you
took the wrong turnin&rsquo; ven you came into the
ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give &rsquo;im a wipe over the mouth,&rdquo; said a
hoarse voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joe Berks,&rdquo; said Jackson, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d save
the hangman the job of breaking your neck if His Royal Highness
wasn&rsquo;t in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as it may be, guv&rsquo;nor,&rdquo; said
the half-drunken ruffian, staggering to his feet.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
I&rsquo;ve said anything wot isn&rsquo;t
genelmanlike&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, Berks!&rdquo; cried my uncle, with such a
tone of command that the fellow collapsed into his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vy, vitch of you would look Tom Slack in the
face?&rdquo; piped the old fellow; &ldquo;or Jack
Broughton?&mdash;him vot told the old Dook of Cumberland that all
he vanted vas to fight the King o&rsquo; Proosia&rsquo;s guard,
day by day, year in, year out, until &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad worked
out the whole regiment of &rsquo;em&mdash;and the smallest of
&rsquo;em six foot long.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s not more&rsquo;n a
few of you could &rsquo;it a dint in a pat o&rsquo; butter, and
if you gets a smack or two it&rsquo;s all over vith you.&nbsp;
Vich among you could get up again after such a vipe as the
Eytalian Gondoleery cove gave to Bob Vittaker?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that, Buckhorse?&rdquo; cried several
voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E came over &rsquo;ere from voreign parts, and
&rsquo;e was so broad &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad to come edgewise through
the doors.&nbsp; &rsquo;E &rsquo;ad so, upon my davy!&nbsp;
&rsquo;E was that strong that wherever &rsquo;e &rsquo;it the
bone had got to go; and when &rsquo;e&rsquo;d cracked a jaw or
two it looked as though nothing in the country could stan&rsquo;
against him.&nbsp; So the King &rsquo;e sent one of his genelmen
down to Figg and he said to him: &lsquo;&rsquo;Ere&rsquo;s a cove
vot cracks a bone every time &rsquo;e lets vly, and it&rsquo;ll
be little credit to the Lunnon boys if they lets &rsquo;im get
avay vithout a vacking.&rsquo;&nbsp; So Figg he ups, and he says,
&lsquo;I do not know, master, but he may break one of &rsquo;is
countrymen&rsquo;s jawbones vid &rsquo;is vist, but I&rsquo;ll
bring &rsquo;im a Cockney lad and &rsquo;e shall not be able to
break &rsquo;is jawbone with a sledge &rsquo;ammer.&rsquo;&nbsp;
I was with Figg in Slaughter&rsquo;s coffee-&rsquo;ouse, as then
vas, ven &rsquo;e says this to the King&rsquo;s genelman, and I
goes so, I does!&rdquo;&nbsp; Again he emitted the curious
bell-like cry, and again the Corinthians and the fighting-men
laughed and applauded him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His Royal Highness&mdash;that is, the Earl of
Chester&mdash;would be glad to hear the end of your story,
Buckhorse,&rdquo; said my uncle, to whom the Prince had been
whispering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vell, your R&rsquo;yal &rsquo;Ighness, it vas like
this.&nbsp; Ven the day came round, all the volk came to
Figg&rsquo;s Amphitheatre, the same that vos in Tottenham Court,
an&rsquo; Bob Vittaker &rsquo;e vos there, and the Eytalian
Gondoleery cove &rsquo;e vas there, and all the purlitest,
genteelest crowd that ever vos, twenty thousand of &rsquo;em, all
sittin&rsquo; with their &rsquo;eads like purtaties on a barrer,
banked right up round the stage, and me there to pick up Bob,
d&rsquo;ye see, and Jack Figg &rsquo;imself just for fair play to
do vot was right by the cove from voreign parts.&nbsp; They vas
packed all round, the folks was, but down through the middle of
&rsquo;em was a passage just so as the gentry could come through
to their seats, and the stage it vas of wood, as the custom then
vas, and a man&rsquo;s &rsquo;eight above the &rsquo;eads of the
people.&nbsp; Vell, then, ven Bob was put up opposite this great
Eytalian man I says &lsquo;Slap &rsquo;im in the vind,
Bob,&rsquo; &rsquo;cos I could see vid &rsquo;alf an eye that he
vas as puffy as a cheesecake; so Bob he goes in, and as he comes
the vorriner let &rsquo;im &rsquo;ave it amazin&rsquo; on the
conk.&nbsp; I &rsquo;eard the thump of it, and I kind o&rsquo;
velt somethin&rsquo; vistle past me, but ven I looked there vas
the Eytalian a feelin&rsquo; of &rsquo;is muscles in the middle
o&rsquo; the stage, and as to Bob, there vern&rsquo;t no
sign&rsquo; of &rsquo;im at all no more&rsquo;n if
&rsquo;e&rsquo;d never been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His audience was riveted by the old prize-fighter&rsquo;s
story.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried a dozen voices,
&ldquo;what then, Buckhorse: &rsquo;ad &rsquo;e swallowed
&rsquo;im, or what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yell, boys, that vas vat <i>I</i> wondered, when sudden
I seed two legs a-stickin&rsquo; up out o&rsquo; the crowd a long
vay off, just like these two vingers, d&rsquo;ye see, and I
knewed they vas Bob&rsquo;s legs, seein&rsquo; that &rsquo;e
&rsquo;ad kind o&rsquo; yellow small clothes vid blue
ribbons&mdash;vich blue vas &rsquo;is colour&mdash;at the
knee.&nbsp; So they up-ended &rsquo;im, they did, an&rsquo; they
made a lane for &rsquo;im an&rsquo; cheered &rsquo;im to give
&rsquo;im &rsquo;eart, though &rsquo;e never lacked for
that.&nbsp; At virst &rsquo;e vas that dazed that &rsquo;e
didn&rsquo;t know if &rsquo;e vas in church or in
&rsquo;Orsemonger Gaol; but ven I&rsquo;d bit &rsquo;is two ears
&rsquo;e shook &rsquo;isself together.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ve&rsquo;ll
try it again, Buck,&rsquo; says &rsquo;e.&nbsp; &lsquo;The
mark!&rsquo; says I.&nbsp; And &rsquo;e vinked all that vas left
o&rsquo; one eye.&nbsp; So the Eytalian &rsquo;e lets swing
again, but Bob &rsquo;e jumps inside an&rsquo; &rsquo;e lets
&rsquo;im &rsquo;ave it plumb square on the meat safe as
&rsquo;ard as ever the Lord would let &rsquo;im put it
in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&nbsp; Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vell, the Eytalian &rsquo;e got a touch of the gurgles,
an&rsquo; &rsquo;e shut &rsquo;imself right up like a two-foot
rule.&nbsp; Then &rsquo;e pulled &rsquo;imself straight,
an&rsquo; &rsquo;e gave the most awful Glory Allelujah screech as
ever you &rsquo;eard.&nbsp; Off &rsquo;e jumps from the stage
an&rsquo; down the passage as &rsquo;ard as &rsquo;is &rsquo;oofs
would carry &rsquo;im.&nbsp; Up jumps the &rsquo;ole crowd, and
after &rsquo;im as &rsquo;ard as they could move for
laughin&rsquo;.&nbsp; They vas lyin&rsquo; in the kennel three
deep all down Tottenham Court road wid their &rsquo;ands to their
sides just vit to break themselves in two.&nbsp; Vell, ve chased
&rsquo;im down &rsquo;Olburn, an&rsquo; down Fleet Street,
an&rsquo; down Cheapside, an&rsquo; past the &rsquo;Change, and
on all the vay to Voppin&rsquo; an&rsquo; we only catched
&rsquo;im in the shippin&rsquo; office, vere &rsquo;e vas
askin&rsquo; &rsquo;ow soon &rsquo;e could get a passage to
voreign parts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was much laughter and clapping of glasses upon the table
at the conclusion of old Buckhorse&rsquo;s story, and I saw the
Prince of Wales hand something to the waiter, who brought it
round and slipped it into the skinny hand of the veteran, who
spat upon it before thrusting it into his pocket.&nbsp; The table
had in the meanwhile been cleared, and was now studded with
bottles and glasses, while long clay pipes and tobacco-boxes were
handed round.&nbsp; My uncle never smoked, thinking that the
habit might darken his teeth, but many of the Corinthians, and
the Prince amongst the first of them, set the example of lighting
up.&nbsp; All restraint had been done away with, and the
prize-fighters, flushed with wine, roared across the tables to
each other, or shouted their greetings to friends at the other
end of the room.&nbsp; The amateurs, falling into the humour of
their company, were hardly less noisy, and loudly debated the
merits of the different men, criticizing their styles of fighting
before their faces, and making bets upon the results of future
matches.</p>
<p>In the midst of the uproar there was an imperative rap upon
the table, and my uncle rose to speak.&nbsp; As he stood with his
pale, calm face and fine figure, I had never seen him to greater
advantage, for he seemed, with all his elegance, to have a quiet
air of domination amongst these fierce fellows, like a huntsman
walking carelessly through a springing and yapping pack.&nbsp; He
expressed his pleasure at seeing so many good sportsmen under one
roof, and acknowledged the honour which had been done both to his
guests and himself by the presence there that night of the
illustrious personage whom he should refer to as the Earl of
Chester.&nbsp; He was sorry that the season prevented him from
placing game upon the table, but there was so much sitting round
it that it would perhaps be hardly missed (cheers and
laughter).&nbsp; The sports of the ring had, in his opinion,
tended to that contempt of pain and of danger which had
contributed so much in the past to the safety of the country, and
which might, if what he heard was true, be very quickly needed
once more.&nbsp; If an enemy landed upon our shores it was then
that, with our small army, we should be forced to fall back upon
native valour trained into hardihood by the practice and
contemplation of manly sports.&nbsp; In time of peace also the
rules of the ring had been of service in enforcing the principles
of fair play, and in turning public opinion against that use of
the knife or of the boot which was so common in foreign
countries.&nbsp; He begged, therefore, to drink &ldquo;Success to
the Fancy,&rdquo; coupled with the name of John Jackson, who
might stand as a type of all that was most admirable in British
boxing.</p>
<p>Jackson having replied with a readiness which many a public
man might have envied, my uncle rose once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are here to-night,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;not only
to celebrate the past glories of the prize ring, but also to
arrange some sport for the future.&nbsp; It should be easy, now
that backers and fighting men are gathered together under one
roof, to come to terms with each other.&nbsp; I have myself set
an example by making a match with Sir Lothian Hume, the terms of
which will be communicated to you by that gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Lothian rose with a paper in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The terms, your Royal Highness and gentlemen, are
briefly these,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;My man, Crab Wilson,
of Gloucester, having never yet fought a prize battle, is
prepared to meet, upon May the 18th of this year, any man of any
weight who may be selected by Sir Charles Tregellis.&nbsp; Sir
Charles Tregellis&rsquo;s selection is limited to men below
twenty or above thirty-five years of age, so as to exclude
Belcher and the other candidates for championship honours.&nbsp;
The stakes are two thousand pounds against a thousand, two
hundred to be paid by the winner to his man; play or
pay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was curious to see the intense gravity of them all,
fighters and backers, as they bent their brows and weighed the
conditions of the match.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am informed,&rdquo; said Sir John Lade, &ldquo;that
Crab Wilson&rsquo;s age is twenty-three, and that, although he
has never fought a regular P.R. battle, he has none the less
fought within ropes for a stake on many occasions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen him half a dozen times at the
least,&rdquo; said Belcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is precisely for that reason, Sir John, that I am
laying odds of two to one in his favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;what the
exact height and weight of Wilson may be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five foot eleven and thirteen-ten, your Royal
Highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Long enough and heavy enough for anything on two
legs,&rdquo; said Jackson, and the professionals all murmured
their assent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Read the rules of the fight, Sir Lothian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The battle to take place on Tuesday, May the 18th, at
the hour of ten in the morning, at a spot to be afterwards
named.&nbsp; The ring to be twenty foot square.&nbsp; Neither to
fall without a knock-down blow, subject to the decision of the
umpires.&nbsp; Three umpires to be chosen upon the ground,
namely, two in ordinary and one in reference.&nbsp; Does that
meet your wishes, Sir Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you anything to say, Wilson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young pugilist, who had a curious, lanky figure, and a
craggy, bony face, passed his fingers through his close-cropped
hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, zir,&rdquo; said he, with a slight
west-country burr, &ldquo;a twenty-voot ring is too small for a
thirteen-stone man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another murmur of professional agreement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have it, Wilson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vour-an&rsquo;-twenty, Sir Lothian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any objection, Sir Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the slightest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything else, Wilson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please, zir, I&rsquo;d like to know whom
I&rsquo;m vighting with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that you have not publicly nominated your
man, Sir Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not intend to do so until the very morning of the
fight.&nbsp; I believe I have that right within the terms of our
wager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, if you choose to exercise it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do so intend.&nbsp; And I should be vastly pleased if
Mr. Berkeley Craven will consent to be stake-holder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That gentleman having willingly given his consent, the final
formalities which led up to these humble tournaments were
concluded.</p>
<p>And then, as these full-blooded, powerful men became heated
with their wine, angry eyes began to glare across the table, and
amid the grey swirls of tobacco-smoke the lamp-light gleamed upon
the fierce, hawk-like Jews, and the flushed, savage Saxons.&nbsp;
The old quarrel as to whether Jackson had or had not committed a
foul by seizing Mendoza by the hair on the occasion of their
battle at Hornchurch, eight years before, came to the front once
more.&nbsp; Dutch Sam hurled a shilling down upon the table, and
offered to fight the Pride of Westminster for it if he ventured
to say that Mendoza had been fairly beaten.&nbsp; Joe Berks, who
had grown noisier and more quarrelsome as the evening went on,
tried to clamber across the table, with horrible blasphemies, to
come to blows with an old Jew named Fighting Yussef, who had
plunged into the discussion.&nbsp; It needed very little more to
finish the supper by a general and ferocious battle, and it was
only the exertions of Jackson, Belcher, Harrison, and others of
the cooler and steadier men, which saved us from a riot.</p>
<p>And then, when at last this question was set aside, that of
the rival claims to championships at different weights came on in
its stead, and again angry words flew about and challenges were
in the air.&nbsp; There was no exact limit between the light,
middle, and heavyweights, and yet it would make a very great
difference to the standing of a boxer whether he should be
regarded as the heaviest of the light-weights, or the lightest of
the heavy-weights.&nbsp; One claimed to be ten-stone champion,
another was ready to take on anything at eleven, but would not
run to twelve, which would have brought the invincible Jem
Belcher down upon him.&nbsp; Faulkner claimed to be champion of
the seniors, and even old Buckhorse&rsquo;s curious call rang out
above the tumult as he turned the whole company to laughter and
good humour again by challenging anything over eighty and under
seven stone.</p>
<p>But in spite of gleams of sunshine, there was thunder in the
air, and Champion Harrison had just whispered in my ear that he
was quite sure that we should never get through the night without
trouble, and was advising me, if it got very bad, to take refuge
under the table, when the landlord entered the room hurriedly and
handed a note to my uncle.</p>
<p>He read it, and then passed it to the Prince, who returned it
with raised eyebrows and a gesture of surprise.&nbsp; Then my
uncle rose with the scrap of paper in his hand and a smile upon
his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there is a stranger
waiting below who desires a fight to a finish with the best men
in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
179</span>CHAPTER XI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE FIGHT IN THE COACH-HOUSE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> curt announcement was followed
by a moment of silent surprise, and then by a general shout of
laughter.&nbsp; There might be argument as to who was champion at
each weight; but there could be no question that all the
champions of all the weights were seated round the tables.&nbsp;
An audacious challenge which embraced them one and all, without
regard to size or age, could hardly be regarded otherwise than as
a joke&mdash;but it was a joke which might be a dear one for the
joker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this genuine?&rdquo; asked my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir Charles,&rdquo; answered the landlord;
&ldquo;the man is waiting below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a kid!&rdquo; cried several of the
fighting-men.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some cove is a gammonin&rsquo;
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe it,&rdquo; answered the
landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a real slap-up Corinthian, by
his dress; and he means what he says, or else I ain&rsquo;t no
judge of a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle whispered for a few moments with the Prince of
Wales.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, at last,
&ldquo;the night is still young, and if any of you should wish to
show the company a little of your skill, you could not ask a
better opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What weight is he, Bill?&rdquo; asked Jem Belcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s close on six foot, and I should put him well
into the thirteen stones when he&rsquo;s buffed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavy metal!&rdquo; cried Jackson.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who
takes him on?&rdquo;</p>
<p>They all wanted to, from nine-stone Dutch Sam upwards.&nbsp;
The air was filled with their hoarse shouts and their arguments
why each should be the chosen one.&nbsp; To fight when they were
flushed with wine and ripe for mischief&mdash;above all, to fight
before so select a company with the Prince at the ringside, was a
chance which did not often come in their way.&nbsp; Only Jackson,
Belcher, Mendoza, and one or two others of the senior and more
famous men remained silent, thinking it beneath their dignity
that they should condescend to so irregular a bye-battle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t all fight him,&rdquo; remarked
Jackson, when the babel had died away.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
for the chairman to choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps your Royal Highness has a preference,&rdquo;
said my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove, I&rsquo;d take him on myself if my position
was different,&rdquo; said the Prince, whose face was growing
redder and his eyes more glazed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen
me with the mufflers, Jackson!&nbsp; You know my form!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen your Royal Highness, and I have felt
your Royal Highness,&rdquo; said the courtly Jackson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Jem Belcher would give us an exhibition,&rdquo;
said my uncle.</p>
<p>Belcher smiled and shook his handsome head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my brother Tom here has never been
blooded in London yet, sir.&nbsp; He might make a fairer match of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him over to me!&rdquo; roared Joe Berks.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been waitin&rsquo; for a turn all
evenin&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll fight any man that tries to
take my place.&nbsp; &rsquo;E&rsquo;s my meat, my masters.&nbsp;
Leave &rsquo;im to me if you want to see &rsquo;ow a calf&rsquo;s
&rsquo;ead should be dressed.&nbsp; If you put Tom Belcher before
me I&rsquo;ll fight Tom Belcher, an&rsquo; for that matter
I&rsquo;ll fight Jem Belcher, or Bill Belcher, or any other
Belcher that ever came out of Bristol.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was clear that Berks had got to the stage when he must
fight some one.&nbsp; His heavy face was gorged and the veins
stood out on his low forehead, while his fierce grey eyes looked
viciously from man to man in quest of a quarrel.&nbsp; His great
red hands were bunched into huge, gnarled fists, and he shook one
of them menacingly as his drunken gaze swept round the
tables.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ll agree with me, gentlemen, that Joe
Berks would be all the better for some fresh air and
exercise,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;With the concurrence
of His Royal Highness and of the company, I shall select him as
our champion on this occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do me proud,&rdquo; cried the fellow, staggering to
his feet and pulling at his coat.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t
glut him within the five minutes, may I never see Shropshire
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a bit, Berks,&rdquo; cried several of the
amateurs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s it going to be
held?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you like, masters.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll fight him in
a sawpit, or on the outside of a coach if it please you.&nbsp;
Put us toe to toe, and leave the rest with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t fight here with all this
litter,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where shall it
be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Pon my soul, Tregellis,&rdquo; cried the Prince,
&ldquo;I think our unknown friend might have a word to say upon
that matter.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll be vastly ill-used if you
don&rsquo;t let him have his own choice of conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, sir.&nbsp; We must have him
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s easy enough,&rdquo; said the landlord,
&ldquo;for here he comes through the doorway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I glanced round and had a side view of a tall and well-dressed
young man in a long, brown travelling coat and a black felt
hat.&nbsp; The next instant he had turned and I had clutched with
both my hands on to Champion Harrison&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harrison!&rdquo; I gasped.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Boy
Jim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And yet somehow the possibility and even the probability of it
had occurred to me from the beginning, and I believe that it had
to Harrison also, for I had noticed that his face grew grave and
troubled from the very moment that there was talk of the stranger
below.&nbsp; Now, the instant that the buzz of surprise and
admiration caused by Jim&rsquo;s face and figure had died away,
Harrison was on his feet, gesticulating in his excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my nephew Jim, gentlemen,&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not twenty yet, and it&rsquo;s no
doing of mine that he should be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him alone, Harrison,&rdquo; cried Jackson.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s big enough to take care of himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This matter has gone rather far,&rdquo; said my
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think, Harrison, that you are too good a
sportsman to prevent your nephew from showing whether he takes
after his uncle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very different from me,&rdquo; cried
Harrison, in great distress.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you
what I&rsquo;ll do, gentlemen.&nbsp; I never thought to stand up
in a ring again, but I&rsquo;ll take on Joe Berks with pleasure,
just to give a bit o&rsquo; sport to this company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Boy Jim stepped across and laid his hand upon the
prize-fighter&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be so, uncle,&rdquo; I heard him whisper.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am sorry to go against your wishes, but I have made up
my mind, and I must carry it through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harrison shrugged his huge shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim, Jim, you don&rsquo;t know what you are
doing!&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ve heard you speak like that before,
boy, and I know that it ends in your getting your way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust, Harrison, that your opposition is
withdrawn?&rdquo; said my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I not take his place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would not have it said that I gave a challenge and
let another carry it out?&rdquo; whispered Jim.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
is my one chance.&nbsp; For Heaven&rsquo;s sake don&rsquo;t stand
in my way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The smith&rsquo;s broad and usually stolid face was all
working with his conflicting emotions.&nbsp; At last he banged
his fist down upon the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no fault of mine!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was to be and it is.&nbsp; Jim, boy, for the
Lord&rsquo;s sake remember your distances, and stick to
out-fightin&rsquo; with a man that could give you a
stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was sure that Harrison would not stand in the way of
sport,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are glad that you
have stepped up, that we might consult you as to the arrangements
for giving effect to your very sporting challenge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom am I to fight?&rdquo; asked Jim, looking round at
the company, who were now all upon their feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young man, you&rsquo;ll know enough of who you
&rsquo;ave to fight before you are through with it,&rdquo; cried
Berks, lurching heavily through the crowd.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need a friend to swear to you before
I&rsquo;ve finished, d&rsquo;ye see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim looked at him with disgust in every line of his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely you are not going to set me to fight a drunken
man!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is Jem
Belcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name, young man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be glad to try you, if I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must work up to me, my lad.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t
take a ladder at one jump, but you do it rung by rung.&nbsp; Show
yourself to be a match for me, and I&rsquo;ll give you a
turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I like the look of you, and wish you well,&rdquo;
said Belcher, holding out his hand.&nbsp; They were not unlike
each other, either in face or figure, though the Bristol man was
a few years the older, and a murmur of critical admiration was
heard as the two tall, lithe figures, and keen, clean-cut faces
were contrasted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any choice where the fight takes place?&rdquo;
asked my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in your hands, sir,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not go round to the Five&rsquo;s Court?&rdquo;
suggested Sir John Lade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, let us go to the Five&rsquo;s Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But this did not at all suit the views of the landlord, who
saw in this lucky incident a chance of reaping a fresh harvest
from his spendthrift company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it please you,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;there is no
need to go so far.&nbsp; My coach-house at the back of the yard
is empty, and a better place for a mill you&rsquo;ll never
find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general shout in favour of the coach-house, and
those who were nearest the door began to slip through, in the
hope of scouring the best places.&nbsp; My stout neighbour, Bill
Warr, pulled Harrison to one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d stop it if I were you,&rdquo; he
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would if I could.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no wish of mine
that he should fight.&nbsp; But there&rsquo;s no turning him when
once his mind is made up.&rdquo;&nbsp; All his own fights put
together had never reduced the pugilist to such a state of
agitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait on &rsquo;im yourself, then, and chuck up the
sponge when things begin to go wrong.&nbsp; You know Joe
Berks&rsquo;s record?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s since my time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, &rsquo;e&rsquo;s a terror, that&rsquo;s
all.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only Belcher that can master
&rsquo;im.&nbsp; You see the man for yourself, six foot, fourteen
stone, and full of the devil.&nbsp; Belcher&rsquo;s beat
&rsquo;im twice, but the second time &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad all
&rsquo;is work to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, we&rsquo;ve got to go through with
it.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve not seen Boy Jim put his mawleys up, or
maybe you&rsquo;d think better of his chances.&nbsp; When he was
short of sixteen he licked the Cock of the South Downs, and
he&rsquo;s come on a long way since then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The company was swarming through the door and clattering down
the stair, so we followed in the stream.&nbsp; A fine rain was
falling, and the yellow lights from the windows glistened upon
the wet cobblestones of the yard.&nbsp; How welcome was that
breath of sweet, damp air after the fetid atmosphere of the
supper-room.&nbsp; At the other end of the yard was an open door
sharply outlined by the gleam of lanterns within, and through
this they poured, amateurs and fighting-men jostling each other
in their eagerness to get to the front.&nbsp; For my own part,
being a smallish man, I should have seen nothing had I not found
an upturned bucket in a corner, upon which I perched myself with
the wall at my back.</p>
<p>It was a large room with a wooden floor and an open square in
the ceiling, which was fringed with the heads of the ostlers and
stable boys who were looking down from the harness-room
above.&nbsp; A carriage-lamp was slung in each corner, and a very
large stable-lantern hung from a rafter in the centre.&nbsp; A
coil of rope had been brought in, and under the direction of
Jackson four men had been stationed to hold it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What space do you give them?&rdquo; asked my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-four, as they are both big ones, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, and half-minutes between rounds, I
suppose?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll umpire if Sir Lothian Hume will do the
same, and you can hold the watch and referee, Jackson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With great speed and exactness every preparation was rapidly
made by these experienced men.&nbsp; Mendoza and Dutch Sam were
commissioned to attend to Berks, while Belcher and Jack Harrison
did the same for Boy Jim.&nbsp; Sponges, towels, and some brandy
in a bladder were passed over the heads of the crowd for the use
of the seconds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s our man,&rdquo; cried Belcher.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Come along, Berks, or we&rsquo;ll go to fetch
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim appeared in the ring stripped to the waist, with a
coloured handkerchief tied round his middle.&nbsp; A shout of
admiration came from the spectators as they looked upon the fine
lines of his figure, and I found myself roaring with the
rest.&nbsp; His shoulders were sloping rather than bulky, and his
chest was deep rather than broad, but the muscle was all in the
right place, rippling down in long, low curves from neck to
shoulder, and from shoulder to elbow.&nbsp; His work at the anvil
had developed his arms to their utmost, and his healthy country
living gave a sleek gloss to his ivory skin, which shone in the
lamplight.&nbsp; His expression was full of spirit and
confidence, and he wore a grim sort of half-smile which I had
seen many a time in our boyhood, and which meant, I knew, that
his pride had set iron hard, and that his senses would fail him
long before his courage.</p>
<p>Joe Berks in the meanwhile had swaggered in and stood with
folded arms between his seconds in the opposite corner.&nbsp; His
face had none of the eager alertness of his opponent, and his
skin, of a dead white, with heavy folds about the chest and ribs,
showed, even to my inexperienced eyes, that he was not a man who
should fight without training.&nbsp; A life of toping and ease
had left him flabby and gross.&nbsp; On the other hand, he was
famous for his mettle and for his hitting power, so that, even in
the face of the advantages of youth and condition, the betting
was three to one in his favour.&nbsp; His heavy-jowled,
clean-shaven face expressed ferocity as well as courage, and he
stood with his small, blood-shot eyes fixed viciously upon Jim,
and his lumpy shoulders stooping a little forwards, like a fierce
hound training on a leash.</p>
<p>The hubbub of the betting had risen until it drowned all other
sounds, men shouting their opinions from one side of the
coach-house to the other, and waving their hands to attract
attention, or as a sign that they had accepted a wager.&nbsp; Sir
John Lade, standing just in front of me, was roaring out the odds
against Jim, and laying them freely with those who fancied the
appearance of the unknown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen Berks fight,&rdquo; said he to the
Honourable Berkeley Craven.&nbsp; &ldquo;No country hawbuck is
going to knock out a man with such a record.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He may be a country hawbuck,&rdquo; the other answered,
&ldquo;but I have been reckoned a judge of anything either on two
legs or four, and I tell you, Sir John, that I never saw a man
who looked better bred in my life.&nbsp; Are you still laying
against him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three to one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you once in hundreds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Craven!&nbsp; There they go!&nbsp;
Berks!&nbsp; Berks!&nbsp; Bravo!&nbsp; Berks!&nbsp; Bravo!&nbsp;
I think, Craven, that I shall trouble you for that
hundred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men had stood up to each other, Jim as light upon his
feet as a goat, with his left well out and his right thrown
across the lower part of his chest, while Berks held both arms
half extended and his feet almost level, so that he might lead
off with either side.&nbsp; For an instant they looked each other
over, and then Berks, ducking his head and rushing in with a
handover-hand style of hitting, bored Jim down into his
corner.&nbsp; It was a backward slip rather than a knockdown, but
a thin trickle of blood was seen at the corner of Jim&rsquo;s
mouth.&nbsp; In an instant the seconds had seized their men and
carried them back into their corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mind doubling our bet?&rdquo; said Berkeley
Craven, who was craning his neck to get a glimpse of Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four to one on Berks!&nbsp; Four to one on
Berks!&rdquo; cried the ringsiders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The odds have gone up, you see.&nbsp; Will you have
four to one in hundreds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Sir John.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to fancy him more for having been knocked
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was pushed down, but he stopped every blow, and I
liked the look on his face as he got up again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the old stager for me.&nbsp; Here they
come again!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s got a pretty style, and he covers
his points well, but it isn&rsquo;t the best looking that
wins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were at it again, and I was jumping about upon my bucket
in my excitement.&nbsp; It was evident that Berks meant to finish
the battle off-hand, whilst Jim, with two of the most experienced
men in England to advise him, was quite aware that his correct
tactics were to allow the ruffian to expend his strength and wind
in vain.&nbsp; There was something horrible in the ferocious
energy of Berks&rsquo;s hitting, every blow fetching a grunt from
him as he smashed it in, and after each I gazed at Jim, as I have
gazed at a stranded vessel upon the Sussex beach when wave after
wave has roared over it, fearing each time that I should find it
miserably mangled.&nbsp; But still the lamplight shone upon the
lad&rsquo;s clear, alert face, upon his well-opened eyes and his
firm-set mouth, while the blows were taken upon his forearm or
allowed, by a quick duck of the head, to whistle over his
shoulder.&nbsp; But Berks was artful as well as violent.&nbsp;
Gradually he worked Jim back into an angle of the ropes from
which there was no escape, and then, when he had him fairly
penned, he sprang upon him like a tiger.&nbsp; What happened was
so quick that I cannot set its sequence down in words, but I saw
Jim make a quick stoop under the swinging arms, and at the same
instant I heard a sharp, ringing smack, and there was Jim dancing
about in the middle of the ring, and Berks lying upon his side on
the floor, with his hand to his eye.</p>
<p>How they roared!&nbsp; Prize-fighters, Corinthians, Prince,
stable-boy, and landlord were all shouting at the top of their
lungs.&nbsp; Old Buckhorse was skipping about on a box beside me,
shrieking out criticisms and advice in strange, obsolete
ring-jargon, which no one could understand.&nbsp; His dull eyes
were shining, his parchment face was quivering with excitement,
and his strange musical call rang out above all the hubbub.&nbsp;
The two men were hurried to their corners, one second sponging
them down and the other flapping a towel in front of their face;
whilst they, with arms hanging down and legs extended, tried to
draw all the air they could into their lungs in the brief space
allowed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your country hawbuck now?&rdquo; cried
Craven, triumphantly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did ever you witness anything
more masterly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s no Johnny Raw, certainly,&rdquo; said Sir
John, shaking his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;What odds are you giving on
Berks, Lord Sole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two to one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take you twice in hundreds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Sir John Lade hedging!&rdquo; cried my
uncle, smiling back at us over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time!&rdquo; said Jackson, and the two men sprang
forward to the mark again.</p>
<p>This round was a good deal shorter than that which had
preceded it.&nbsp; Berks&rsquo;s orders evidently were to close
at any cost, and so make use of his extra weight and strength
before the superior condition of his antagonist could have time
to tell.&nbsp; On the other hand, Jim, after his experience in
the last round, was less disposed to make any great exertion to
keep him at arms&rsquo; length.&nbsp; He led at Berks&rsquo;s
head, as he came rushing in, and missed him, receiving a severe
body blow in return, which left the imprint of four angry
knuckles above his ribs.&nbsp; As they closed Jim caught his
opponent&rsquo;s bullet head under his arm for an instant, and
put a couple of half-arm blows in; but the prize-fighter pulled
him over by his weight, and the two fell panting side by side
upon the ground.&nbsp; Jim sprang up, however, and walked over to
his corner, while Berks, distressed by his evening&rsquo;s
dissipation, leaned one arm upon Mendoza and the other upon Dutch
Sam as he made for his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bellows to mend!&rdquo; cried Jem Belcher.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the four to one now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give us time to get the lid off our pepper-box,&rdquo;
said Mendoza.&nbsp; &ldquo;We mean to make a night of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it,&rdquo; said Jack Harrison.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s shut one of his eyes already.&nbsp; Even money
that my boy wins it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much?&rdquo; asked several voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two pound four and threepence,&rdquo; cried Harrison,
counting out all his worldly wealth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time!&rdquo; said Jackson once more.</p>
<p>They were both at the mark in an instant, Jim as full of
sprightly confidence as ever, and Berks with a fixed grin upon
his bull-dog face and a most vicious gleam in the only eye which
was of use to him.&nbsp; His half-minute had not enabled him to
recover his breath, and his huge, hairy chest was rising and
falling with a quick, loud panting like a spent hound.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go in, boy!&nbsp; Bustle him!&rdquo; roared Harrison and
Belcher.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get your wind, Joe; get your wind!&rdquo;
cried the Jews.&nbsp; So now we had a reversal of tactics, for it
was Jim who went in to hit with all the vigour of his young
strength and unimpaired energy, while it was the savage Berks who
was paying his debt to Nature for the many injuries which he had
done her.&nbsp; He gasped, he gurgled, his face grew purple in
his attempts to get his breath, while with his long left arm
extended and his right thrown across, he tried to screen himself
from the attack of his wiry antagonist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drop when he
hits!&rdquo; cried Mendoza.&nbsp; &ldquo;Drop and have a
rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But there was no shyness or shiftiness about Berks&rsquo;s
fighting.&nbsp; He was always a gallant ruffian, who disdained to
go down before an antagonist as long as his legs would sustain
him.&nbsp; He propped Jim off with his long arm, and though the
lad sprang lightly round him looking for an opening, he was held
off as if a forty-inch bar of iron were between them.&nbsp; Every
instant now was in favour of Berks, and already his breathing was
easier and the bluish tinge fading from his face.&nbsp; Jim knew
that his chance of a speedy victory was slipping away from him,
and he came back again and again as swift as a flash to the
attack without being able to get past the passive defence of the
trained fighting-man.&nbsp; It was at such a moment that
ringcraft was needed, and luckily for Jim two masters of it were
at his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get your left on his mark, boy,&rdquo; they shouted,
&ldquo;then go to his head with the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim heard and acted on the instant.&nbsp; Plunk! came his left
just where his antagonist&rsquo;s ribs curved from his
breast-bone.&nbsp; The force of the blow was half broken by
Berks&rsquo;s elbow, but it served its purpose of bringing
forward his head.&nbsp; Spank! went the right, with the clear,
crisp sound of two billiard balls clapping together, and Berks
reeled, flung up his arms, spun round, and fell in a huge, fleshy
heap upon the floor.&nbsp; His seconds were on him instantly, and
propped him up in a sitting position, his head rolling helplessly
from one shoulder to the other, and finally toppling backwards
with his chin pointed to the ceiling.&nbsp; Dutch Sam thrust the
brandy-bladder between his teeth, while Mendoza shook him
savagely and howled insults in his ear, but neither the spirits
nor the sense of injury could break into that serene
insensibility.&nbsp; &ldquo;Time!&rdquo; was duly called, and the
Jews, seeing that the affair was over, let their man&rsquo;s head
fall back with a crack upon the floor, and there he lay, his huge
arms and legs asprawl, whilst the Corinthians and fighting-men
crowded past him to shake the hand of his conqueror.</p>
<p>For my part, I tried also to press through the throng, but it
was no easy task for one of the smallest and weakest men in the
room.&nbsp; On all sides of me I heard a brisk discussion from
amateurs and professionals of Jim&rsquo;s performance and of his
prospects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the best bit of new stuff that I&rsquo;ve
seen since Jem Belcher fought his first fight with Paddington
Jones at Wormwood Scrubbs four years ago last April,&rdquo; said
Berkeley Craven.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see him with the belt
round his waist before he&rsquo;s five-and-twenty, or I am no
judge of a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That handsome face of his has cost me a cool five
hundred,&rdquo; grumbled Sir John Lade.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who&rsquo;d
have thought he was such a punishing hitter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For all that,&rdquo; said another, &ldquo;I am
confident that if Joe Berks had been sober he would have eaten
him.&nbsp; Besides, the lad was in training, and the other would
burst like an overdone potato if he were hit.&nbsp; I never saw a
man so soft, or with his wind in such condition.&nbsp; Put the
men in training, and it&rsquo;s a horse to a hen on the
bruiser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some agreed with the last speaker and some were against him,
so that a brisk argument was being carried on around me.&nbsp; In
the midst of it the Prince took his departure, which was the
signal for the greater part of the company to make for the
door.&nbsp; In this way I was able at last to reach the corner
where Jim had just finished his dressing, while Champion
Harrison, with tears of joy still shining upon his cheeks, was
helping him on with his overcoat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In four rounds!&rdquo; he kept repeating in a sort of
an ecstasy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Joe Berks in four rounds!&nbsp; And it
took Jem Belcher fourteen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Roddy,&rdquo; cried Jim, holding out his hand,
&ldquo;I told you that I would come to London and make my name
known.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was splendid, Jim!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear old Roddy!&nbsp; I saw your white face staring at
me from the corner.&nbsp; You are not changed, for all your grand
clothes and your London friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you who are changed, Jim,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;I
hardly knew you when you came into the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I,&rdquo; cried the smith.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where got
you all these fine feathers, Jim?&nbsp; Sure I am that it was not
your aunt who helped you to the first step towards the
prize-ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Hinton has been my friend&mdash;the best friend I
ever had.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&nbsp; I thought as much,&rdquo; grumbled the
smith.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, it is no doing of mine, Jim, and you
must bear witness to that when we go home again.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;but, there, it is done, and it
can&rsquo;t be helped.&nbsp; After all, she&rsquo;s&mdash;Now,
the deuce take my clumsy tongue!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not tell whether it was the wine which he had taken at
supper or the excitement of Boy Jim&rsquo;s victory which was
affecting Harrison, but his usually placid face wore a most
disturbed expression, and his manner seemed to betray an
alternation of exultation and embarrassment.&nbsp; Jim looked
curiously at him, wondering evidently what it was that lay behind
these abrupt sentences and sudden silences.&nbsp; The coach-house
had in the mean time been cleared; Berks with many curses had
staggered at last to his feet, and had gone off in company with
two other bruisers, while Jem Belcher alone remained chatting
very earnestly with my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Belcher,&rdquo; I heard my uncle say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a real pleasure to me to do it, sir,&rdquo;
and the famous prize-fighter, as the two walked towards us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wished to ask you, Jim Harrison, whether you would
undertake to be my champion in the fight against Crab Wilson of
Gloucester?&rdquo; said my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I want, Sir Charles&mdash;to have a chance
of fighting my way upwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are heavy stakes upon the event&mdash;very heavy
stakes,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will receive two
hundred pounds, if you win.&nbsp; Does that satisfy
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall fight for the honour, and because I wish to be
thought worthy of being matched against Jem Belcher.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belcher laughed good-humouredly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going the right way about it, lad,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you had a soft thing on to-night with a
drunken man who was out of condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not wish to fight him,&rdquo; said Jim,
flushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know you have spirit enough to fight anything on
two legs.&nbsp; I knew that the instant I clapped eyes on you;
but I want you to remember that when you fight Crab Wilson, you
will fight the most promising man from the west, and that the
best man of the west is likely to be the best man in
England.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s as quick and as long in the reach as
you are, and he&rsquo;ll train himself to the last half-ounce of
tallow.&nbsp; I tell you this now, d&rsquo;ye see, because if
I&rsquo;m to have the charge of you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Charge of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Belcher has
consented to train you for the coming battle if you are willing
to enter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure I am very much obliged to you,&rdquo; cried
Jim, heartily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Unless my uncle should wish to train
me, there is no one I would rather have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, Jim; I&rsquo;ll stay with you a few days, but
Belcher knows a deal more about training than I do.&nbsp; Where
will the quarters be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought it would be handy for you if we fixed it at
the George, at Crawley.&nbsp; Then, if we have choice of place,
we might choose Crawley Down, for, except Molesey Hurst, and,
maybe, Smitham Bottom, there isn&rsquo;t a spot in the country
that would compare with it for a mill.&nbsp; Do you agree with
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;re my man from this hour on, d&rsquo;ye
see?&rdquo; said Belcher.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your food is mine, and
your drink is mine, and your sleep is mine, and all you&rsquo;ve
to do is just what you are told.&nbsp; We haven&rsquo;t an hour
to lose, for Wilson has been in half-training this month
back.&nbsp; You saw his empty glass to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim&rsquo;s fit to fight for his life at the present
moment,&rdquo; said Harrison.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we&rsquo;ll both
come down to Crawley to-morrow.&nbsp; So good night, Sir
Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, Roddy,&rdquo; said Jim.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll come down to Crawley and see me at my
training quarters, will you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And I heartily promised that I would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be more careful, nephew,&rdquo; said my uncle,
as we rattled home in his model <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>En premi&egrave;re jeunesse</i> one is a little
inclined to be ruled by one&rsquo;s heart rather than by
one&rsquo;s reason.&nbsp; Jim Harrison seems to be a most
respectable young fellow, but after all he is a
blacksmith&rsquo;s apprentice, and a candidate for the
prize-ring.&nbsp; There is a vast gap between his position and
that of my own blood relation, and you must let him feel that you
are his superior.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the oldest and dearest friend that I have in the
world, sir,&rdquo; I answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;We were boys
together, and have never had a secret from each other.&nbsp; As
to showing him that I am his superior, I don&rsquo;t know how I
can do that, for I know very well that he is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hum!&rdquo; said my uncle, drily, and it was the last
word that he addressed to me that night.</p>

201</span>CHAPTER XII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE COFFEE-ROOM OF
FLADONG&rsquo;S.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span> Boy Jim went down to the George,
at Crawley, under the charge of Jim Belcher and Champion
Harrison, to train for his great fight with Crab Wilson, of
Gloucester, whilst every club and bar parlour of London rang with
the account of how he had appeared at a supper of Corinthians,
and beaten the formidable Joe Berks in four rounds.&nbsp; I
remembered that afternoon at Friar&rsquo;s Oak when Jim had told
me that he would make his name known, and his words had come true
sooner than he could have expected it, for, go where one might,
one heard of nothing but the match between Sir Lothian Hume and
Sir Charles Tregellis, and the points of the two probable
combatants.&nbsp; The betting was still steadily in favour of
Wilson, for he had a number of bye-battles to set against this
single victory of Jim&rsquo;s, and it was thought by connoisseurs
who had seen him spar that the singular defensive tactics which
had given him his nickname would prove very puzzling to a raw
antagonist.&nbsp; In height, strength, and reputation for
gameness there was very little to choose between them, but Wilson
had been the more severely tested.</p>
<p>It was but a few days before the battle that my father made
his promised visit to London.&nbsp; The seaman had no love of
cities, and was happier wandering over the Downs, and turning his
glass upon every topsail which showed above the horizon, than
when finding his way among crowded streets, where, as he
complained, it was impossible to keep a course by the sun, and
hard enough by dead reckoning.&nbsp; Rumours of war were in the
air, however, and it was necessary that he should use his
influence with Lord Nelson if a vacancy were to be found either
for himself or for me.</p>
<p>My uncle had just set forth, as was his custom of an evening,
clad in his green riding-frock, his plate buttons, his Cordovan
boots, and his round hat, to show himself upon his crop-tailed
tit in the Mall.&nbsp; I had remained behind, for, indeed, I had
already made up my mind that I had no calling for this
fashionable life.&nbsp; These men, with their small waists, their
gestures, and their unnatural ways, had become wearisome to me,
and even my uncle, with his cold and patronizing manner, filled
me with very mixed feelings.&nbsp; My thoughts were back in
Sussex, and I was dreaming of the kindly, simple ways of the
country, when there came a rat-tat at the knocker, the ring of a
hearty voice, and there, in the doorway, was the smiling,
weather-beaten face, with the puckered eyelids and the light blue
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Roddy, you are grand indeed!&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I had rather see you with the
King&rsquo;s blue coat upon your back than with all these frills
and ruffles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I had rather wear it, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It warms my heart to hear you say so.&nbsp; Lord Nelson
has promised me that he would find a berth for you, and to-morrow
we shall seek him out and remind him of it.&nbsp; But where is
your uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is riding in the Mall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of relief passed over my father&rsquo;s honest face,
for he was never very easy in his brother-in-law&rsquo;s
company.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been to the Admiralty,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;and I trust that I shall have a ship when war breaks
out; by all accounts it will not be long first.&nbsp; Lord St.
Vincent told me so with his own lips.&nbsp; But I am at
Fladong&rsquo;s, Rodney, where, if you will come and sup with me,
you will see some of my messmates from the
Mediterranean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When you think that in the last year of the war we had 140,000
seamen and mariners afloat, commanded by 4000 officers, and that
half of these had been turned adrift when the Peace of Amiens
laid their ships up in the Hamoaze or Portsdown creek, you will
understand that London, as well as the dockyard towns, was full
of seafarers.&nbsp; You could not walk the streets without
catching sight of the gipsy-faced, keen-eyed men whose plain
clothes told of their thin purses as plainly as their listless
air showed their weariness of a life of forced and unaccustomed
inaction.&nbsp; Amid the dark streets and brick houses there was
something out of place in their appearance, as when the
sea-gulls, driven by stress of weather, are seen in the Midland
shires.&nbsp; Yet while prize-courts procrastinated, or there was
a chance of an appointment by showing their sunburned faces at
the Admiralty, so long they would continue to pace with their
quarter-deck strut down Whitehall, or to gather of an evening to
discuss the events of the last war or the chances of the next at
Fladong&rsquo;s, in Oxford Street, which was reserved as entirely
for the Navy as Slaughter&rsquo;s was for the Army, or
Ibbetson&rsquo;s for the Church of England.</p>
<p>It did not surprise me, therefore, that we should find the
large room in which we supped crowded with naval men, but I
remember that what did cause me some astonishment was to observe
that all these sailors, who had served under the most varying
conditions in all quarters of the globe, from the Baltic to the
East Indies, should have been moulded into so uniform a type that
they were more like each other than brother is commonly to
brother.&nbsp; The rules of the service insured that every face
should be clean-shaven, every head powdered, and every neck
covered by the little queue of natural hair tied with a black
silk ribbon.&nbsp; Biting winds and tropical suns had combined to
darken them, whilst the habit of command and the menace of
ever-recurring dangers had stamped them all with the same
expression of authority and of alertness.&nbsp; There were some
jovial faces amongst them, but the older officers, with their
deep-lined cheeks and their masterful noses, were, for the most
part, as austere as so many weather-beaten ascetics from the
desert.&nbsp; Lonely watches, and a discipline which cut them off
from all companionship, had left their mark upon those Red Indian
faces.&nbsp; For my part, I could hardly eat my supper for
watching them.&nbsp; Young as I was, I knew that if there were
any freedom left in Europe it was to these men that we owed it;
and I seemed to read upon their grim, harsh features the record
of that long ten years of struggle which had swept the tricolour
from the seas.</p>
<p>When we had finished our supper, my father led me into the
great coffee-room, where a hundred or more officers may have been
assembled, drinking their wine and smoking their long clay pipes,
until the air was as thick as the main-deck in a close-fought
action.&nbsp; As we entered we found ourselves face to face with
an elderly officer who was coming out.&nbsp; He was a man with
large, thoughtful eyes, and a full, placid face&mdash;such a face
as one would expect from a philosopher and a philanthropist,
rather than from a fighting seaman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Cuddie Collingwood,&rdquo; whispered my
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halloa, Lieutenant Stone!&rdquo; cried the famous
admiral very cheerily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have scarce caught a
glimpse of you since you came aboard the <i>Excellent</i> after
St. Vincent.&nbsp; You had the luck to be at the Nile also, I
understand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was third of the <i>Theseus</i>, under Millar,
sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It nearly broke my heart to have missed it.&nbsp; I
have not yet outlived it.&nbsp; To think of such a gallant
service, and I engaged in harassing the market-boats, the
miserable cabbage-carriers of St. Luccars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your plight was better than mine, Sir Cuthbert,&rdquo;
said a voice from behind us, and a large man in the full uniform
of a post-captain took a step forward to include himself in our
circle.&nbsp; His mastiff face was heavy with emotion, and he
shook his head miserably as he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Troubridge, I can understand and sympathize
with your feelings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I passed through torment that night, Collingwood.&nbsp;
It left a mark on me that I shall never lose until I go over the
ship&rsquo;s side in a canvas cover.&nbsp; To have my beautiful
<i>Culloden</i> laid on a sandbank just out of gunshot.&nbsp; To
hear and see the fight the whole night through, and never to pull
a lanyard or take the tompions out of my guns.&nbsp; Twice I
opened my pistol-case to blow out my brains, and it was but the
thought that Nelson might have a use for me that held me
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Collingwood shook the hand of the unfortunate captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Admiral Nelson was not long in finding a use for you,
Troubridge,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have all heard of
your siege of Capua, and how you ran up your ship&rsquo;s guns
without trenches or parallels, and fired point-blank through the
embrasures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The melancholy cleared away from the massive face of the big
seaman, and his deep laughter filled the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not clever enough or slow enough for their
Z-Z fashions,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;We got alongside and
slapped it in through their port-holes until they struck their
colours.&nbsp; But where have you been, Sir Cuthbert?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With my wife and my two little lasses at Morpeth in the
North Country.&nbsp; I have but seen them this once in ten years,
and it may be ten more, for all I know, ere I see them
again.&nbsp; I have been doing good work for the fleet up
yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had thought, sir, that it was inland,&rdquo; said my
father.</p>
<p>Collingwood took a little black bag out of his pocket and
shook it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Inland it is,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;and yet I have
done good work for the fleet there.&nbsp; What do you suppose I
hold in this bag?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullets,&rdquo; said Troubridge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something that a sailor needs even more than
that,&rdquo; answered the admiral, and turning it over he tilted
a pile of acorns on to his palm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I carry them with
me in my country walks, and where I see a fruitful nook I thrust
one deep with the end of my cane.&nbsp; My oak trees may fight
those rascals over the water when I am long forgotten.&nbsp; Do
you know, lieutenant, how many oaks go to make an eighty-gun
ship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two thousand, no less.&nbsp; For every two-decked ship
that carries the white ensign there is a grove the less in
England.&nbsp; So how are our grandsons to beat the French if we
do not give them the trees with which to build their
ships?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He replaced his bag in his pocket, and then, passing his arm
through Troubridge&rsquo;s, they went through the door
together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man whose life might help you to trim
your own course,&rdquo; said my father, as we took our seats at a
vacant table.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is ever the same quiet gentleman,
with his thoughts busy for the comfort of his ship&rsquo;s
company, and his heart with his wife and children whom he has so
seldom seen.&nbsp; It is said in the fleet that an oath has never
passed his lips, Rodney, though how he managed when he was first
lieutenant of a raw crew is more than I can conceive.&nbsp; But
they all love Cuddie, for they know he&rsquo;s an angel to
fight.&nbsp; How d&rsquo;ye do, Captain Foley?&nbsp; My respects,
Sir Ed&rsquo;ard!&nbsp; Why, if they could but press the company,
they would man a corvette with flag officers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s many a man here, Rodney,&rdquo; continued
my father, as he glanced about him, &ldquo;whose name may never
find its way into any book save his own ship&rsquo;s log, but who
in his own way has set as fine an example as any admiral of them
all.&nbsp; We know them, and talk of them in the fleet, though
they may never be bawled in the streets of London.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s as much seamanship and pluck in a good cutter
action as in a line-o&rsquo;-battleship fight, though you may not
come by a title nor the thanks of Parliament for it.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s Hamilton, for example, the quiet, pale-faced man
who is learning against the pillar.&nbsp; It was he who, with six
rowing-boats, cut out the 44-gun frigate <i>Hermione</i> from
under the muzzles of two hundred shore-guns in the harbour of
Puerto Cabello.&nbsp; No finer action was done in the whole
war.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s Jaheel Brenton, with the whiskers.&nbsp;
It was he who attacked twelve Spanish gunboats in his one little
brig, and made four of them strike to him.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
Walker, of the <i>Rose</i> cutter, who, with thirteen men,
engaged three French privateers with crews of a hundred and
forty-six.&nbsp; He sank one, captured one, and chased the
third.&nbsp; How are you, Captain Ball?&nbsp; I hope I see you
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two or three of my father&rsquo;s acquaintances who had been
sitting close by drew up their chairs to us, and soon quite a
circle had formed, all talking loudly and arguing upon sea
matters, shaking their long, red-tipped pipes at each other as
they spoke.&nbsp; My father whispered in my ear that his
neighbour was Captain Foley, of the <i>Goliath</i>, who led the
van at the Nile, and that the tall, thin, foxy-haired man
opposite was Lord Cochrane, the most dashing frigate captain in
the Service.&nbsp; Even at Friar&rsquo;s Oak we had heard how, in
the little <i>Speedy</i>, of fourteen small guns with fifty-four
men, he had carried by boarding the Spanish frigate <i>Gamo</i>
with her crew of three hundred.&nbsp; It was easy to see that he
was a quick, irascible, high-blooded man, for he was talking
hotly about his grievances with a flush of anger upon his
freckled cheeks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall never do any good upon the ocean until we have
hanged the dockyard contractors,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d have a dead dockyard contractor as a figure-head
for every first-rate in the fleet, and a provision dealer for
every frigate.&nbsp; I know them with their puttied seams and
their devil bolts, risking five hundred lives that they may steal
a few pounds&rsquo; worth of copper.&nbsp; What became of the
<i>Chance</i>, and of the <i>Martin</i>, and of the
<i>Orestes</i>?&nbsp; They foundered at sea, and were never heard
of more, and I say that the crews of them were murdered
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lord Cochrane seemed to be expressing the views of all, for a
murmur of assent, with a mutter of hearty, deep-sea curses, ran
round the circle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those rascals over yonder manage things better,&rdquo;
said an old one-eyed captain, with the blue-and-white riband for
St. Vincent peeping out of his third buttonhole.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They sheer away their heads if they get up to any
foolery.&nbsp; Did ever a vessel come out of Toulon as my 38-gun
frigate did from Plymouth last year, with her masts rolling about
until her shrouds were like iron bars on one side and hanging in
festoons upon the other?&nbsp; The meanest sloop that ever sailed
out of France would have overmatched her, and then it would be on
me, and not on this Devonport bungler, that a court-martial would
be called.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They loved to grumble, those old salts, for as soon as one had
shot off his grievance his neighbour would follow with another,
each more bitter than the last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at our sails!&rdquo; cried Captain Foley.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Put a French and a British ship at anchor together, and
how can you tell which is which?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frenchy has his fore and maintop-gallant masts about
equal,&rdquo; said my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the old ships, maybe, but how many of the new are
laid down on the French model?&nbsp; No, there&rsquo;s no way of
telling them at anchor.&nbsp; But let them hoist sail, and how
d&rsquo;you tell them then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frenchy has white sails,&rdquo; cried several.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And ours are black and rotten.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
difference.&nbsp; No wonder they outsail us when the wind can
blow through our canvas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the <i>Speedy</i>,&rdquo; said Cochrane, &ldquo;the
sailcloth was so thin that, when I made my observation, I always
took my meridian through the foretopsail and my horizon through
the foresail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a general laugh at this, and then at it they all
went again, letting off into speech all those weary broodings and
silent troubles which had rankled during long years of service,
for an iron discipline prevented them from speaking when their
feet were upon their own quarter-decks.&nbsp; One told of his
powder, six pounds of which were needed to throw a ball a
thousand yards.&nbsp; Another cursed the Admiralty Courts, where
a prize goes in as a full-rigged ship and comes out as a
schooner.&nbsp; The old captain spoke of the promotions by
Parliamentary interest which had put many a youngster into the
captain&rsquo;s cabin when he should have been in the
gun-room.&nbsp; And then they came back to the difficulty of
finding crews for their vessels, and they all together raised up
their voices and wailed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the use of building fresh ships,&rdquo; cried
Foley, &ldquo;when even with a ten-pound bounty you can&rsquo;t
man the ships that you have got?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Lord Cochrane was on the other side in this question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d have the men, sir, if you treated them well
when you got them,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Admiral Nelson
can get his ships manned.&nbsp; So can Admiral Collingwood.&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; Because he has thought for the men, and so the men
have thought for him.&nbsp; Let men and officers know and respect
each other, and there&rsquo;s no difficulty in keeping a
ship&rsquo;s company.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the infernal plan of
turning a crew over from ship to ship and leaving the officers
behind that rots the Navy.&nbsp; But I have never found a
difficulty, and I dare swear that if I hoist my pennant to-morrow
I shall have all my old <i>Speedies</i> back, and as many
volunteers as I care to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very well, my lord,&rdquo; said the old
captain, with some warmth; &ldquo;when the Jacks hear that the
<i>Speedy</i> took fifty vessels in thirteen months, they are
sure to volunteer to serve with her commander.&nbsp; Every good
cruiser can fill her complement quickly enough.&nbsp; But it is
not the cruisers that fight the country&rsquo;s battles and
blockade the enemy&rsquo;s ports.&nbsp; I say that all
prize-money should be divided equally among the whole fleet, and
until you have such a rule, the smartest men will always be found
where they are of least service to any one but
themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This speech produced a chorus of protests from the cruiser
officers and a hearty agreement from the line-of-battleship men,
who seemed to be in the majority in the circle which had gathered
round.&nbsp; From the flushed faces and angry glances it was
evident that the question was one upon which there was strong
feeling upon both sides.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the cruiser gets the cruiser earns,&rdquo; cried a
frigate captain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say, sir,&rdquo; said Captain Foley,
&ldquo;that the duties of an officer upon a cruiser demand more
care or higher professional ability than those of one who is
employed upon blockade service, with a lee coast under him
whenever the wind shifts to the west, and the topmasts of an
enemy&rsquo;s squadron for ever in his sight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not claim higher ability, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why should you claim higher pay?&nbsp; Can you
deny that a seaman before the mast makes more in a fast frigate
than a lieutenant can in a battleship?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only last year,&rdquo; said a very
gentlemanly-looking officer, who might have passed for a buck
upon town had his skin not been burned to copper in such sunshine
as never bursts upon London&mdash;&ldquo;it was only last year
that I brought the old <i>Alexander</i> back from the
Mediterranean, floating like an empty barrel and carrying nothing
but honour for her cargo.&nbsp; In the Channel we fell in with
the frigate <i>Minerva</i> from the Western Ocean, with her lee
ports under water and her hatches bursting with the plunder which
had been too valuable to trust to the prize crews.&nbsp; She had
ingots of silver along her yards and bowsprit, and a bit of
silver plate at the truck of the masts.&nbsp; My Jacks could have
fired into her, and would, too, if they had not been held
back.&nbsp; It made them mad to think of all they had done in the
south, and then to see this saucy frigate flashing her money
before their eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see their grievance, Captain Ball,&rdquo; said
Cochrane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you are promoted to a two-decker, my lord, it will
possibly become clearer to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak as if a cruiser had nothing to do but take
prizes.&nbsp; If that is your view, you will permit me to say
that you know very little of the matter.&nbsp; I have handled a
sloop, a corvette, and a frigate, and I have found a great
variety of duties in each of them.&nbsp; I have had to avoid the
enemy&rsquo;s battleships and to fight his cruisers.&nbsp; I have
had to chase and capture his privateers, and to cut them out when
they run under his batteries.&nbsp; I have had to engage his
forts, to take my men ashore, and to destroy his guns and his
signal stations.&nbsp; All this, with convoying, reconnoitring,
and risking one&rsquo;s own ship in order to gain a knowledge of
the enemy&rsquo;s movements, comes under the duties of the
commander of a cruiser.&nbsp; I make bold to say that the man who
can carry these objects out with success has deserved better of
the country than the officer of a battleship, tacking from Ushant
to the Black Rocks and back again until she builds up a reef with
her beef-bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the angry old sailor, &ldquo;such an
officer is at least in no danger of being mistaken for a
privateersman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am surprised, Captain Bulkeley,&rdquo; Cochran
retorted hotly, &ldquo;that you should venture to couple the
names of privateersman and King&rsquo;s officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was mischief brewing among these hot-headed,
short-spoken salts, but Captain Foley changed the subject to
discuss the new ships which were being built in the French
ports.&nbsp; It was of interest to me to hear these men, who were
spending their lives in fighting against our neighbours,
discussing their character and ways.&nbsp; You cannot
conceive&mdash;you who live in times of peace and
charity&mdash;how fierce the hatred was in England at that time
against the French, and above all against their great
leader.&nbsp; It was more than a mere prejudice or dislike.&nbsp;
It was a deep, aggressive loathing of which you may even now form
some conception if you examine the papers or caricatures of the
day.&nbsp; The word &ldquo;Frenchman&rdquo; was hardly spoken
without &ldquo;rascal&rdquo; or &ldquo;scoundrel&rdquo; slipping
in before it.&nbsp; In all ranks of life and in every part of the
country the feeling was the same.&nbsp; Even the Jacks aboard our
ships fought with a viciousness against a French vessel which
they would never show to Dane, Dutchman, or Spaniard.</p>
<p>If you ask me now, after fifty years, why it was that there
should have been this virulent feeling against them, so foreign
to the easy-going and tolerant British nature, I would confess
that I think the real reason was fear.&nbsp; Not fear of them
individually, of course&mdash;our foulest detractors have never
called us faint-hearted&mdash;but fear of their star, fear of
their future, fear of the subtle brain whose plans always seemed
to go aright, and of the heavy hand which had struck nation after
nation to the ground.&nbsp; We were but a small country, with a
population which, when the war began, was not much more than half
that of France.&nbsp; And then, France had increased by leaps and
bounds, reaching out to the north into Belgium and Holland, and
to the south into Italy, whilst we were weakened by deep-lying
disaffection among both Catholics and Presbyterians in
Ireland.&nbsp; The danger was imminent and plain to the least
thoughtful.&nbsp; One could not walk the Kent coast without
seeing the beacons heaped up to tell the country of the
enemy&rsquo;s landing, and if the sun were shining on the uplands
near Boulogne, one might catch the flash of its gleam upon the
bayonets of manoeuvring veterans.&nbsp; No wonder that a fear of
the French power lay deeply in the hearts of the most gallant
men, and that fear should, as it always does, beget a bitter and
rancorous hatred.</p>
<p>The seamen did not speak kindly then of their recent
enemies.&nbsp; Their hearts loathed them, and in the fashion of
our country their lips said what the heart felt.&nbsp; Of the
French officers they could not have spoken with more chivalry, as
of worthy foemen, but the nation was an abomination to
them.&nbsp; The older men had fought against them in the American
War, they had fought again for the last ten years, and the
dearest wish of their hearts seemed to be that they might be
called upon to do the same for the remainder of their days.&nbsp;
Yet if I was surprised by the virulence of their animosity
against the French, I was even more so to hear how highly they
rated them as antagonists.&nbsp; The long succession of British
victories which had finally made the French take to their ports
and resign the struggle in despair had given all of us the idea
that for some reason a Briton on the water must, in the nature of
things, always have the best of it against a Frenchman.&nbsp; But
these men who had done the fighting did not think so.&nbsp; They
were loud in their praise of their foemen&rsquo;s gallantry, and
precise in their reasons for his defeat.&nbsp; They showed how
the officers of the old French Navy had nearly all been
aristocrats.&nbsp; How the Revolution had swept them out of their
ships, and the force been left with insubordinate seamen and no
competent leaders.&nbsp; This ill-directed fleet had been hustled
into port by the pressure of the well-manned and well-commanded
British, who had pinned them there ever since, so that they had
never had an opportunity of learning seamanship.&nbsp; Their
harbour drill and their harbour gunnery had been of no service
when sails had to be trimmed and broadsides fired on the heave of
an Atlantic swell.&nbsp; Let one of their frigates get to sea and
have a couple of years&rsquo; free run in which the crew might
learn their duties, and then it would be a feather in the cap of
a British officer if with a ship of equal force he could bring
down her colours.</p>
<p>Such were the views of these experienced officers, fortified
by many reminiscences and examples of French gallantry, such as
the way in which the crew of the <i>L&rsquo;Orient</i> had fought
her quarter-deck guns when the main-deck was in a blaze beneath
them, and when they must have known that they were standing over
an exploding magazine.&nbsp; The general hope was that the West
Indian expedition since the peace might have given many of their
fleet an ocean training, and that they might be tempted out into
mid-Channel if the war were to break out afresh.&nbsp; But would
it break out afresh?&nbsp; We had spent gigantic sums and made
enormous exertions to curb the power of Napoleon and to prevent
him from becoming the universal despot of Europe.&nbsp; Would the
Government try it again?&nbsp; Or were they appalled by the
gigantic load of debt which must bend the backs of many
generations unborn?&nbsp; Pitt was there, and surely he was not a
man to leave his work half done.</p>
<p>And then suddenly there was a bustle at the door.&nbsp; Amid
the grey swirl of the tobacco-smoke I could catch a glimpse of a
blue coat and gold epaulettes, with a crowd gathering thickly
round them, while a hoarse murmur rose from the group which
thickened into a deep-chested cheer.&nbsp; Every one was on his
feet, peering and asking each other what it might mean.&nbsp; And
still the crowd seethed and the cheering swelled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; What has happened?&rdquo; cried a
score of voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put him up!&nbsp; Hoist him up!&rdquo; shouted
somebody, and an instant later I saw Captain Troubridge appear
above the shoulders of the crowd.&nbsp; His face was flushed, as
if he were in wine, and he was waving what seemed to be a letter
in the air.&nbsp; The cheering died away, and there was such a
hush that I could hear the crackle of the paper in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great news, gentlemen!&rdquo; he roared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Glorious news!&nbsp; Rear-Admiral Collingwood has directed
me to communicate it to you.&nbsp; The French Ambassador has
received his papers to-night.&nbsp; Every ship on the list is to
go into commission.&nbsp; Admiral Cornwallis is ordered out of
Cawsand Bay to cruise off Ushant.&nbsp; A squadron is starting
for the North Sea and another for the Irish Channel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He may have had more to say, but his audience could wait no
longer.&nbsp; How they shouted and stamped and raved in their
delight!&nbsp; Harsh old flag-officers, grave post-captains,
young lieutenants, all were roaring like schoolboys breaking up
for the holidays.&nbsp; There was no thought now of those
manifold and weary grievances to which I had listened.&nbsp; The
foul weather was passed, and the landlocked sea-birds would be
out on the foam once more.&nbsp; The rhythm of &ldquo;God Save
the King&rdquo; swelled through the babel, and I heard the old
lines sung in a way that made you forget their bad rhymes and
their bald sentiments.&nbsp; I trust that you will never hear
them so sung, with tears upon rugged cheeks, and catchings of the
breath from strong men.&nbsp; Dark days will have come again
before you hear such a song or see such a sight as that.&nbsp;
Let those talk of the phlegm of our countrymen who have never
seen them when the lava crust of restraint is broken, and when
for an instant the strong, enduring fires of the North glow upon
the surface.&nbsp; I saw them then, and if I do not see them now,
I am not so old or so foolish as to doubt that they are
there.</p>

221</span>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LORD NELSON.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> father&rsquo;s appointment with
Lord Nelson was an early one, and he was the more anxious to be
punctual as he knew how much the Admiral&rsquo;s movements must
be affected by the news which we had heard the night
before.&nbsp; I had hardly breakfasted then, and my uncle had not
rung for his chocolate, when he called for me at Jermyn
Street.&nbsp; A walk of a few hundred yards brought us to the
high building of discoloured brick in Piccadilly, which served
the Hamiltons as a town house, and which Nelson used as his
head-quarters when business or pleasure called him from
Merton.&nbsp; A footman answered our knock, and we were ushered
into a large drawing-room with sombre furniture and melancholy
curtains.&nbsp; My father sent in his name, and there we sat,
looking at the white Italian statuettes in the corners, and the
picture of Vesuvius and the Bay of Naples which hung over the
harpsichord.&nbsp; I can remember that a black clock was ticking
loudly upon the mantelpiece, and that every now and then, amid
the rumble of the hackney coaches, we could hear boisterous
laughter from some inner chamber.</p>
<p>When at last the door opened, both my father and I sprang to
our feet, expecting to find ourselves face to face with the
greatest living Englishman.&nbsp; It was a very different person,
however, who swept into the room.</p>
<p>She was a lady, tall, and, as it seemed to me, exceedingly
beautiful, though, perhaps, one who was more experienced and more
critical might have thought that her charm lay in the past rather
than the present.&nbsp; Her queenly figure was moulded upon large
and noble lines, while her face, though already tending to become
somewhat heavy and coarse, was still remarkable for the
brilliancy of the complexion, the beauty of the large, light blue
eyes, and the tinge of the dark hair which curled over the low
white forehead.&nbsp; She carried herself in the most stately
fashion, so that as I looked at her majestic entrance, and at the
pose which she struck as she glanced at my father, I was reminded
of the Queen of the Peruvians as, in the person of Miss Polly
Hinton, she incited Boy Jim and myself to insurrection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lieutenant Anson Stone?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your ladyship,&rdquo; answered my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she cried, with an affected and exaggerated
start, &ldquo;you know me, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen your ladyship at Naples.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have doubtless seen my poor Sir William
also&mdash;my poor, poor Sir William!&rdquo;&nbsp; She touched
her dress with her white, ring-covered fingers, as if to draw our
attention to the fact that she was in the deepest mourning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard of your ladyship&rsquo;s sad loss,&rdquo; said
my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We died together,&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
can my life be now save a long-drawn living death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke in a beautiful, rich voice, with the most
heart-broken thrill in it, but I could not conceal from myself
that she appeared to be one of the most robust persons that I had
ever seen, and I was surprised to notice that she shot arch
little questioning glances at me, as if the admiration even of so
insignificant a person were of some interest to her.&nbsp; My
father, in his blunt, sailor fashion, tried to stammer out some
commonplace condolence, but her eyes swept past his rude,
weather-beaten face to ask and reask what effect she had made
upon me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he hangs, the tutelary angel of this
house,&rdquo; she cried, pointing with a grand sweeping gesture
to a painting upon the wall, which represented a very thin-faced,
high-nosed gentleman with several orders upon his coat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But enough of my private sorrow!&rdquo;&nbsp; She dashed
invisible tears from her eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have come to see
Lord Nelson.&nbsp; He bid me say that he would be with you in an
instant.&nbsp; You have doubtless heard that hostilities are
about to reopen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We heard the news last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Nelson is under orders to take command of the
Mediterranean Fleet.&nbsp; You can think at such a
moment&mdash;But, ah, is it not his lordship&rsquo;s step that I
hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My attention was so riveted by the lady&rsquo;s curious manner
and by the gestures and attitudes with which she accompanied
every remark, that I did not see the great admiral enter the
room.&nbsp; When I turned he was standing close by my elbow, a
small, brown man with the lithe, slim figure of a boy.&nbsp; He
was not clad in uniform, but he wore a high-collared brown coat,
with the right sleeve hanging limp and empty by his side.&nbsp;
The expression of his face was, as I remember it, exceedingly sad
and gentle, with the deep lines upon it which told of the chafing
of his urgent and fiery soul.&nbsp; One eye was disfigured and
sightless from a wound, but the other looked from my father to
myself with the quickest and shrewdest of expressions.&nbsp;
Indeed, his whole manner, with his short, sharp glance and the
fine poise of the head, spoke of energy and alertness, so that he
reminded me, if I may compare great things with small, of a
well-bred fighting terrier, gentle and slim, but keen and ready
for whatever chance might send.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Lieutenant Stone,&rdquo; said he, with great
cordiality, holding out his left hand to my father, &ldquo;I am
very glad to see you.&nbsp; London is full of Mediterranean men,
but I trust that in a week there will not be an officer amongst
you all with his feet on dry land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had come to ask you, sir, if you could assist me to a
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have one, Stone, if my word goes for anything
at the Admiralty.&nbsp; I shall want all my old Nile men at my
back.&nbsp; I cannot promise you a first-rate, but at least it
shall be a 64-gun ship, and I can tell you that there is much to
be done with a handy, well-manned, well-found 64-gun
ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who could doubt it who has heard of the
<i>Agamemnon</i>?&rdquo; cried Lady Hamilton, and straightway she
began to talk of the admiral and of his doings with such
extravagance of praise and such a shower of compliments and of
epithets, that my father and I did not know which way to look,
feeling shame and sorrow for a man who was compelled to listen to
such things said in his own presence.&nbsp; But when I ventured
to glance at Lord Nelson I found, to my surprise, that, far from
showing any embarrassment, he was smiling with pleasure, as if
this gross flattery of her ladyship&rsquo;s were the dearest
thing in all the world to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, my dear lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you
speak vastly beyond my merits;&rdquo; upon which encouragement
she started again in a theatrical apostrophe to Britain&rsquo;s
darling and Neptune&rsquo;s eldest son, which he endured with the
same signs of gratitude and pleasure.&nbsp; That a man of the
world, five-and-forty years of age, shrewd, honest, and
acquainted with Courts, should be beguiled by such crude and
coarse homage, amazed me, as it did all who knew him; but you who
have seen much of life do not need to be told how often the
strongest and noblest nature has its one inexplicable weakness,
showing up the more obviously in contrast to the rest, as the
dark stain looks the fouler upon the whitest sheet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a sea-officer of my own heart, Stone,&rdquo;
said he, when her ladyship had exhausted her panegyric.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are one of the old breed!&rdquo;&nbsp; He walked up
and down the room with little, impatient steps as he talked,
turning with a whisk upon his heel every now and then, as if some
invisible rail had brought him up.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are getting
too fine for our work with these new-fangled epaulettes and
quarter-deck trimmings.&nbsp; When I joined the Service, you
would find a lieutenant gammoning and rigging his own bowsprit,
or aloft, maybe, with a marlinspike slung round his neck, showing
an example to his men.&nbsp; Now, it&rsquo;s as much as
he&rsquo;ll do to carry his own sextant up the companion.&nbsp;
When could you join?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-night, my lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right, Stone, right!&nbsp; That is the true
spirit.&nbsp; They are working double tides in the yards, but I
do not know when the ships will be ready.&nbsp; I hoist my flag
on the <i>Victory</i> on Wednesday, and we sail at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; not so soon!&nbsp; She cannot be ready for
sea,&rdquo; said Lady Hamilton, in a wailing voice, clasping her
hands and turning up her eyes as she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must and she shall be ready,&rdquo; cried Nelson,
with extraordinary vehemence.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Heaven! if the
devil stands at the door, I sail on Wednesday.&nbsp; Who knows
what these rascals may be doing in my absence?&nbsp; It maddens
me to think of the deviltries which they may be devising.&nbsp;
At this very instant, dear lady, the Queen, <i>our</i> Queen, may
be straining her eyes for the topsails of Nelson&rsquo;s
ships.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thinking, as I did, that he was speaking of our own old Queen
Charlotte, I could make no meaning out of this; but my father
told me afterwards that both Nelson and Lady Hamilton had
conceived an extraordinary affection for the Queen of Naples, and
that it was the interests of her little kingdom which he had so
strenuously at heart.&nbsp; It may have been my expression of
bewilderment which attracted Nelson&rsquo;s attention to me, for
he suddenly stopped in his quick quarter-deck walk, and looked me
up and down with a severe eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, young gentleman!&rdquo; said he, sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my only son, sir,&rdquo; said my father.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is my wish that he should join the Service, if a berth
can be found for him; for we have all been King&rsquo;s officers
for many generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, you wish to come and have your bones broken?&rdquo;
cried Nelson, roughly, looking with much disfavour at the fine
clothes which had cost my uncle and Mr. Brummel such a
debate.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will have to change that grand coat for
a tarry jacket if you serve under me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was so embarrassed by the abruptness of his manner that I
could but stammer out that I hoped I should do my duty, on which
his stern mouth relaxed into a good-humoured smile, and he laid
his little brown hand for an instant upon my shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say that you will do very well,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can see that you have the stuff in you.&nbsp;
But do not imagine that it is a light service which you
undertake, young gentleman, when you enter His Majesty&rsquo;s
Navy.&nbsp; It is a hard profession.&nbsp; You hear of the few
who succeed, but what do you know of the hundreds who never find
their way?&nbsp; Look at my own luck!&nbsp; Out of 200 who were
with me in the San Juan expedition, 145 died in a single
night.&nbsp; I have been in 180 engagements, and I have, as you
see, lost my eye and my arm, and been sorely wounded
besides.&nbsp; It chanced that I came through, and here I am
flying my admiral&rsquo;s flag; but I remember many a man as good
as me who did not come through.&nbsp; Yes,&rdquo; he added, as
her ladyship broke in with a voluble protest, &ldquo;many and
many as good a man who has gone to the sharks or the
land-crabs.&nbsp; But it is a useless sailor who does not risk
himself every day, and the lives of all of us are in the hands of
Him who best knows when to claim them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant, in his earnest gaze and reverent manner, we
seemed to catch a glimpse of the deeper, truer Nelson, the man of
the Eastern counties, steeped in the virile Puritanism which sent
from that district the Ironsides to fashion England within, and
the Pilgrim Fathers to spread it without.&nbsp; Here was the
Nelson who declared that he saw the hand of God pressing upon the
French, and who waited on his knees in the cabin of his flag-ship
while she bore down upon the enemy&rsquo;s line.&nbsp; There was
a human tenderness, too, in his way of speaking of his dead
comrades, which made me understand why it was that he was so
beloved by all who served with him, for, iron-hard as he was as
seaman and fighter, there ran through his complex nature a sweet
and un-English power of affectionate emotion, showing itself in
tears if he were moved, and in such tender impulses as led him
afterwards to ask his flag-captain to kiss him as he lay dying in
the cockpit of the <i>Victory</i>.</p>
<p>My father had risen to depart, but the admiral, with that
kindliness which he ever showed to the young, and which had been
momentarily chilled by the unfortunate splendour of my clothes,
still paced up and down in front of us, shooting out crisp little
sentences of exhortation and advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is ardour that we need in the Service, young
gentleman,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;We need red-hot men who
will never rest satisfied.&nbsp; We had them in the
Mediterranean, and we shall have them again.&nbsp; There was a
band of brothers!&nbsp; When I was asked to recommend one for
special service, I told the Admiralty they might take the names
as they came, for the same spirit animated them all.&nbsp; Had we
taken nineteen vessels, we should never have said it was well
done while the twentieth sailed the seas.&nbsp; You know how it
was with us, Stone.&nbsp; You are too old a Mediterranean man for
me to tell you anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust, my lord, that I shall be with you when next we
meet them,&rdquo; said my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet them we shall and must.&nbsp; By Heaven, I shall
never rest until I have given them a shaking.&nbsp; The scoundrel
Buonaparte wishes to humble us.&nbsp; Let him try, and God help
the better cause!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with such extraordinary animation that the empty
sleeve flapped about in the air, giving him the strangest
appearance.&nbsp; Seeing my eyes fixed upon it, he turned with a
smile to my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can still work my fin, Stone,&rdquo; said he, putting
his hand across to the stump of his arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;What used
they to say in the fleet about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it was a sign, sir, that it was a bad hour to
cross your hawse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They knew me, the rascals.&nbsp; You can see, young
gentleman, that not a scrap of the ardour with which I serve my
country has been shot away.&nbsp; Some day you may find that you
are flying your own flag, and when that time comes you may
remember that my advice to an officer is that he should have
nothing to do with tame, slow measures.&nbsp; Lay all your stake,
and if you lose through no fault of your own, the country will
find you another stake as large.&nbsp; Never mind
man&oelig;uvres!&nbsp; Go for them!&nbsp; The only man&oelig;uvre
you need is that which will place you alongside your enemy.&nbsp;
Always fight, and you will always be right.&nbsp; Give not a
thought to your own ease or your own life, for from the day that
you draw the blue coat over your back you have no life of your
own.&nbsp; It is the country&rsquo;s, to be most freely spent if
the smallest gain can come from it.&nbsp; How is the wind this
morning, Stone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;East-south-east,&rdquo; my father answered,
readily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Cornwallis is, doubtless, keeping well up to
Brest, though, for my own part, I had rather tempt them out into
the open sea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what every officer and man in the fleet would
prefer, your lordship,&rdquo; said my father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They do not love the blockading service, and it is
little wonder, since neither money nor honour is to be gained at
it.&nbsp; You can remember how it was in the winter months before
Toulon, Stone, when we had neither firing, wine, beef, pork, nor
flour aboard the ships, nor a spare piece of rope, canvas, or
twine.&nbsp; We braced the old hulks with our spare cables, and
God knows there was never a Levanter that I did not expect it to
send us to the bottom.&nbsp; But we held our grip all the
same.&nbsp; Yet I fear that we do not get much credit for it here
in England, Stone, where they light the windows for a great
battle, but they do not understand that it is easier for us to
fight the Nile six times over, than to keep our station all
winter in the blockade.&nbsp; But I pray God that we may meet
this new fleet of theirs and settle the matter by a pell-mell
battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I be with you, my lord!&rdquo; said my father,
earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we have already taken too much of
your time, and so I beg to thank you for your kindness and to
wish you good morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Stone!&rdquo; said Nelson.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You shall have your ship, and if I can make this young
gentleman one of my officers it shall be done.&nbsp; But I gather
from his dress,&rdquo; he continued, running his eye over me,
&ldquo;that you have been more fortunate in prize-money than most
of your comrades.&nbsp; For my own part, I never did nor could
turn my thoughts to money-making.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My father explained that I had been under the charge of the
famous Sir Charles Tregellis, who was my uncle, and with whom I
was now residing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you need no help from me,&rdquo; said Nelson, with
some bitterness.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you have either guineas or
interest you can climb over the heads of old sea-officers, though
you may not know the poop from the galley, or a carronade from a
long nine.&nbsp; Nevertheless&mdash;But what the deuce have we
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The footman had suddenly precipitated himself into the room,
but stood abashed before the fierce glare of the admiral&rsquo;s
eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your lordship told me to rush to you if it should
come,&rdquo; he explained, holding out a large blue envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Heaven, it is my orders!&rdquo; cried Nelson,
snatching it up and fumbling with it in his awkward, one-handed
attempt to break the seals.&nbsp; Lady Hamilton ran to his
assistance, but no sooner had she glanced at the paper inclosed
than she burst into a shrill scream, and throwing up her hands
and her eyes, she sank backwards in a swoon.&nbsp; I could not
but observe, however, that her fall was very carefully executed,
and that she was fortunate enough, in spite of her insensibility,
to arrange her drapery and attitude into a graceful and classical
design.&nbsp; But he, the honest seaman, so incapable of deceit
or affectation that he could not suspect it in others, ran madly
to the bell, shouting for the maid, the doctor, and the
smelling-salts, with incoherent words of grief, and such
passionate terms of emotion that my father thought it more
discreet to twitch me by the sleeve as a signal that we should
steal from the room.&nbsp; There we left him then in the dim-lit
London drawing-room, beside himself with pity for this shallow
and most artificial woman, while without, at the edge of the
Piccadilly curb, there stood the high dark berline ready to start
him upon that long journey which was to end in his chase of the
French fleet over seven thousand miles of ocean, his meeting with
it, his victory, which confined Napoleon&rsquo;s ambition for
ever to the land, and his death, coming, as I would it might come
to all of us, at the crowning moment of his life.</p>

234</span>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">ON THE ROAD.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now the day of the great fight
began to approach.&nbsp; Even the imminent outbreak of war and
the renewed threats of Napoleon were secondary things in the eyes
of the sportsmen&mdash;and the sportsmen in those days made a
large half of the population.&nbsp; In the club of the patrician
and the plebeian gin-shop, in the coffee-house of the merchant or
the barrack of the soldier, in London or the provinces, the same
question was interesting the whole nation.&nbsp; Every
west-country coach brought up word of the fine condition of Crab
Wilson, who had returned to his own native air for his training,
and was known to be under the immediate care of Captain Barclay,
the expert.&nbsp; On the other hand, although my uncle had not
yet named his man, there was no doubt amongst the public that Jim
was to be his nominee, and the report of his physique and of his
performance found him many backers.&nbsp; On the whole, however,
the betting was in favour of Wilson, for Bristol and the west
country stood by him to a man, whilst London opinion was
divided.&nbsp; Three to two were to be had on Wilson at any West
End club two days before the battle.</p>
<p>I had twice been down to Crawley to see Jim in his training
quarters, where I found him undergoing the severe regimen which
was usual.&nbsp; From early dawn until nightfall he was running,
jumping, striking a bladder which swung upon a bar, or sparring
with his formidable trainer.&nbsp; His eyes shone and his skin
glowed with exuberent health, and he was so confident of success
that my own misgivings vanished as I watched his gallant bearing
and listened to his quiet and cheerful words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I wonder that you should come and see me now,
Rodney,&rdquo; said he, when we parted, trying to laugh as he
spoke.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have become a bruiser and your
uncle&rsquo;s paid man, whilst you are a Corinthian upon
town.&nbsp; If you had not been the best and truest little
gentleman in the world, you would have been my patron instead of
my friend before now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I looked at this splendid fellow, with his high-bred,
clean-cut face, and thought of the fine qualities and gentle,
generous impulses which I knew to lie within him, it seemed so
absurd that he should speak as though my friendship towards him
were a condescension, that I could not help laughing aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is all very well, Rodney,&rdquo; said he, looking
hard into my eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;But what does your uncle think
about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a poser, and I could only answer lamely enough that,
much as I was indebted to my uncle, I had known Jim first, and
that I was surely old enough to choose my own friends.</p>
<p>Jim&rsquo;s misgivings were so far correct that my uncle did
very strongly object to any intimacy between us; but there were
so many other points in which he disapproved of my conduct, that
it made the less difference.&nbsp; I fear that he was already
disappointed in me.&nbsp; I would not develop an eccentricity,
although he was good enough to point out several by which I might
&ldquo;come out of the ruck,&rdquo; as he expressed it, and so
catch the attention of the strange world in which he lived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an active young fellow, nephew,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you not think that you could engage to climb
round the furniture of an ordinary room without setting foot upon
the ground?&nbsp; Some little <i>tour-de-force</i> of the sort is
in excellent taste.&nbsp; There was a captain in the Guards who
attained considerable social success by doing it for a small
wager.&nbsp; Lady Lieven, who is exceedingly exigeant, used to
invite him to her evenings merely that he might exhibit
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had to assure him that the feat would be beyond me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are just a little <i>difficile</i>,&rdquo; said he,
shrugging his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;As my nephew, you might
have taken your position by perpetuating my own delicacy of
taste.&nbsp; If you had made bad taste your enemy, the world of
fashion would willingly have looked upon you as an arbiter by
virtue of your family traditions, and you might without a
struggle have stepped into the position to which this young
upstart Brummell aspires.&nbsp; But you have no instinct in that
direction.&nbsp; You are incapable of minute attention to
detail.&nbsp; Look at your shoes!&nbsp; Look at your
cravat!&nbsp; Look at your watch-chain!&nbsp; Two links are
enough to show.&nbsp; I <i>have</i> shown three, but it was an
indiscretion.&nbsp; At this moment I can see no less than five of
yours.&nbsp; I regret it, nephew, but I do not think that you are
destined to attain that position which I have a right to expect
from my blood relation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry to be a disappointment to you, sir,&rdquo;
said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your misfortune not to have come under my
influence earlier,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I might then have
moulded you so as to have satisfied even my own
aspirations.&nbsp; I had a younger brother whose case was a
similar one.&nbsp; I did what I could for him, but he would wear
ribbons in his shoes, and he publicly mistook white Burgundy for
Rhine wine.&nbsp; Eventually the poor fellow took to books, and
lived and died in a country vicarage.&nbsp; He was a good man,
but he was commonplace, and there is no place in society for
commonplace people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I fear, sir, that there is none for me,&rdquo;
said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;But my father has every hope that Lord
Nelson will find me a position in the fleet.&nbsp; If I have been
a failure in town, I am none the less conscious of your kindness
in trying to advance my interests, and I hope that, should I
receive my commission, I may be a credit to you yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible that you may attain the very spot which
I had marked out for you, but by another road,&rdquo; said my
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are many men in town, such as Lord St.
Vincent, Lord Hood, and others, who move in the most respectable
circles, although they have nothing but their services in the
Navy to recommend them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was on the afternoon of the day before the fight that this
conversation took place between my uncle and myself in the dainty
sanctum of his Jermyn-Street house.&nbsp; He was clad, I
remember, in his flowing brocade dressing-gown, as was his custom
before he set off for his club, and his foot was extended upon a
stool&mdash;for Abernethy had just been in to treat him for an
incipient attack of the gout.&nbsp; It may have been the pain, or
it may have been his disappointment at my career, but his manner
was more testy than was usual with him, and I fear that there was
something of a sneer in his smile as he spoke of my
deficiencies.&nbsp; For my own part I was relieved at the
explanation, for my father had left London in the full conviction
that a vacancy would speedily be found for us both, and the one
thing which had weighed upon my mind was that I might have found
it hard to leave my uncle without interfering with the plans
which he had formed.&nbsp; I was heart-weary of this empty life,
for which I was so ill-fashioned, and weary also of that
intolerant talk which would make a coterie of frivolous women and
foolish fops the central point of the universe.&nbsp; Something
of my uncle&rsquo;s sneer may have flickered upon my lips as I
heard him allude with supercilious surprise to the presence in
those sacrosanct circles of the men who had stood between the
country and destruction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, nephew,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;gout or no
gout, and whether Abernethy likes it or not, we must be down at
Crawley to-night.&nbsp; The battle will take place upon Crawley
Downs.&nbsp; Sir Lothian Hume and his man are at Reigate.&nbsp; I
have reserved beds at the George for both of us.&nbsp; The crush
will, it is said, exceed anything ever known.&nbsp; The smell of
these country inns is always most offensive to me&mdash;<i>mais
que voulez-vous</i>?&nbsp; Berkeley Craven was saying in the club
last night that there is not a bed within twenty miles of Crawley
which is not bespoke, and that they are charging three guineas
for the night.&nbsp; I hope that your young friend, if I must
describe him as such, will fulfil the promise which he has shown,
for I have rather more upon the event than I care to lose.&nbsp;
Sir Lothian has been plunging also&mdash;he made a single bye-bet
of five thousand to three upon Wilson in Limmer&rsquo;s
yesterday.&nbsp; From what I hear of his affairs it will be a
serious matter for him if we should pull it off.&nbsp; Well,
Lorimer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A person to see you, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said the new
valet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that I never see any one until my dressing is
complete.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He insists upon seeing you, sir.&nbsp; He pushed open
the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pushed it open!&nbsp; What d&rsquo;you mean,
Lorimer?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you put him out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smile passed over the servant&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; At the
same moment there came a deep voice from the passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You show me in this instant, young man, d&rsquo;ye
&rsquo;ear?&nbsp; Let me see your master, or it&rsquo;ll be the
worse for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought that I had heard the voice before, but when, over
the shoulder of the valet, I caught a glimpse of a large, fleshy,
bull-face, with a flattened Michael Angelo nose in the centre of
it, I knew at once that it was my neighbour at the supper
party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Warr, the prizefighter, sir,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said our visitor, pushing his huge
form into the room.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Bill Warr, landlord
of the One Ton public-&rsquo;ouse, Jermyn Street, and the gamest
man upon the list.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s only one thing that ever
beat me, Sir Charles, and that was my flesh, which creeps over me
that amazin&rsquo; fast that I&rsquo;ve always got four stone
that &rsquo;as no business there.&nbsp; Why, sir, I&rsquo;ve got
enough to spare to make a feather-weight champion out of.&nbsp;
You&rsquo;d &rsquo;ardly think, to look at me, that even after
Mendoza fought me I was able to jump the four-foot ropes at the
ring-side just as light as a little kiddy; but if I was to chuck
my castor into the ring now I&rsquo;d never get it till the wind
blew it out again, for blow my dicky if I could climb
after.&nbsp; My respec&rsquo;s to you, young sir, and I
&rsquo;ope I see you well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle&rsquo;s face had expressed considerable disgust at
this invasion of his privacy, but it was part of his position to
be on good terms with the fighting-men, so he contented himself
with asking curtly what business had brought him there.&nbsp; For
answer the huge prizefighter looked meaningly at the valet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s important, Sir Charles, and between man and
man,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may go, Lorimer.&nbsp; Now, Warr, what is the
matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bruiser very calmly seated himself astride of a chair with
his arms resting upon the back of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got information, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; cried my uncle,
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Information of value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out with it, then!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Information that&rsquo;s worth money,&rdquo; said Warr,
and pursed up his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see.&nbsp; You want to be paid for what you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prizefighter smiled an affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t buy things on trust.&nbsp; You
should know me better than to try on such a game with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you for what you are, Sir Charles, and that is a
noble, slap-up Corinthian.&nbsp; But if I was to use this against
you, d&rsquo;ye see, it would be worth &rsquo;undreds in my
pocket.&nbsp; But my &rsquo;eart won&rsquo;t let me do it, for
Bill Warr&rsquo;s always been on the side o&rsquo; good sport and
fair play.&nbsp; If I use it for you, then I expect that you
won&rsquo;t see me the loser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can do what you like,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If your news is of service to me, I shall know how to
treat you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t say fairer than that.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll
let it stand there, gov&rsquo;nor, and you&rsquo;ll do the
&rsquo;andsome thing, as you &rsquo;ave always &rsquo;ad the name
for doin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Well, then, your man, Jim &rsquo;Arisen,
fights Crab Wilson, of Gloucester, at Crawley Down to-morrow
mornin&rsquo; for a stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you &rsquo;appen to know what the bettin&rsquo; was
yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was three to two on Wilson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right you are, gov&rsquo;nor.&nbsp; Three to two was
offered in my own bar-parlour.&nbsp; D&rsquo;you know what the
bettin&rsquo; is to-day?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not been out yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll tell you.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s seven to one
against your man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven to one, gov&rsquo;nor, no less.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re talking nonsense, Warr!&nbsp; How could
the betting change from three to two to seven to one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ive been to Tom Owen&rsquo;s, and I&rsquo;ve been to
the &rsquo;Ole in the Wall, and I&rsquo;ve been to the Waggon and
&rsquo;Orses, and you can get seven to one in any of them.&nbsp;
There&rsquo;s tons of money being laid against your man.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a &rsquo;orse to a &rsquo;en in every sportin&rsquo;
&rsquo;ouse and boozin&rsquo; ken from &rsquo;ere to
Stepney.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment the expression upon my uncle&rsquo;s face made me
realize that this match was really a serious matter to him.&nbsp;
Then he shrugged his shoulders with an incredulous smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the worse for the fools who give the odds,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;My man is all right.&nbsp; You saw him
yesterday, nephew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was all right yesterday, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If anything had gone wrong I should have
heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But perhaps,&rdquo; said Warr, &ldquo;it &rsquo;as not
gone wrong with &rsquo;im <i>yet</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What d&rsquo;you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I mean, sir.&nbsp; You
remember Berks?&nbsp; You know that &rsquo;e ain&rsquo;t to be
overmuch depended on at any time, and that &rsquo;e &rsquo;ad a
grudge against your man &rsquo;cause &rsquo;e laid &rsquo;im out
in the coach-&rsquo;ouse.&nbsp; Well, last night about ten
o&rsquo;clock in &rsquo;e comes into my bar, and the three
bloodiest rogues in London at &rsquo;is &rsquo;eels.&nbsp; There
was Red Ike, &rsquo;im that was warned off the ring &rsquo;cause
&rsquo;e fought a cross with Bittoon; and there was
Fightin&rsquo; Yussef, who would sell &rsquo;is mother for a
seven-shillin&rsquo;-bit; the third was Chris McCarthy, who is a
fogle-snatcher by trade, with a pitch outside the &rsquo;Aymarket
Theatre.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t often see four such beauties
together, and all with as much as they could carry, save only
Chris, who is too leary a cove to drink when there&rsquo;s
somethin&rsquo; goin&rsquo; forward.&nbsp; For my part, I showed
&rsquo;em into the parlour, not &rsquo;cos they was worthy of it,
but &rsquo;cos I knew right well they would start bashin&rsquo;
some of my customers, and maybe get my license into trouble if I
left &rsquo;em in the bar.&nbsp; I served &rsquo;em with drink,
and stayed with &rsquo;em just to see that they didn&rsquo;t lay
their &rsquo;ands on the stuffed parroquet and the pictures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, gov&rsquo;nor, to cut it short, they began to
talk about the fight, and they all laughed at the idea that young
Jim &rsquo;Arrison could win it&mdash;all except Chris, and
e&rsquo; kept a-nudging and a-twitchin&rsquo; at the others until
Joe Berks nearly gave him a wipe across the face for &rsquo;is
trouble.&nbsp; I saw somethin&rsquo; was in the wind, and it
wasn&rsquo;t very &rsquo;ard to guess what it
was&mdash;especially when Red Ike was ready to put up a fiver
that Jim &rsquo;Arrison would never fight at all.&nbsp; So I up
to get another bottle of liptrap, and I slipped round to the
shutter that we pass the liquor through from the private bar into
the parlour.&nbsp; I drew it an inch open, and I might &rsquo;ave
been at the table with them, I could &rsquo;ear every word that
clearly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was Chris McCarthy growlin&rsquo; at them for not
keepin&rsquo; their tongues still, and there was Joe Berks
swearin&rsquo; that &rsquo;e would knock &rsquo;is face in if
&rsquo;e dared give &rsquo;im any of &rsquo;is lip.&nbsp; So
Chris &rsquo;e sort of argued with them, for &rsquo;e was
frightened of Berks, and &rsquo;e put it to them whether they
would be fit for the job in the mornin&rsquo;, and whether the
gov&rsquo;nor would pay the money if &rsquo;e found they
&rsquo;ad been drinkin&rsquo; and were not to be trusted.&nbsp;
This struck them sober, all three, an&rsquo; Fighting Yussef
asked what time they were to start.&nbsp; Chris said that as long
as they were at Crawley before the George shut up they could work
it.&nbsp; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s poor pay for a chance of a
rope,&rsquo; said Red Ike.&nbsp; &lsquo;Rope be damned!&rsquo;
cried Chris, takin&rsquo; a little loaded stick out of his side
pocket.&nbsp; &lsquo;If three of you &rsquo;old him down and I
break his arm-bone with this, we&rsquo;ve earned our money, and
we don&rsquo;t risk more&rsquo;n six months&rsquo;
jug.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;&rsquo;E&rsquo;ll fight,&rsquo; said
Berks.&nbsp; &lsquo;Well, it&rsquo;s the only fight
&rsquo;e&rsquo;ll get,&rsquo; answered Chris, and that was all I
&rsquo;eard of it.&nbsp; This mornin&rsquo; out I went, and I
found as I told you afore that the money is goin&rsquo; on to
Wilson by the ton, and that no odds are too long for the
layers.&nbsp; So it stands, gov&rsquo;nor, and you know what the
meanin&rsquo; of it may be better than Bill Warr can tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Warr,&rdquo; said my uncle, rising.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am very much obliged to you for telling me this, and I
will see that you are not a loser by it.&nbsp; I put it down as
the gossip of drunken ruffians, but none the less you have served
me vastly by calling my attention to it.&nbsp; I suppose I shall
see you at the Downs to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Jackson &rsquo;as asked me to be one o&rsquo; the
beaters-out, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good.&nbsp; I hope that we shall have a fair and
good fight.&nbsp; Good day to you, and thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle had preserved his jaunty demeanour as long as Warr
was in the room, but the door had hardly closed upon him before
he turned to me with a face which was more agitated than I had
ever seen it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be off for Crawley at once, nephew,&rdquo; said
he, ringing the bell.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a moment to
be lost.&nbsp; Lorimer, order the bays to be harnessed in the
curricle.&nbsp; Put the toilet things in, and tell William to
have it round at the door as soon as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see to it, sir,&rdquo; said I, and away I
ran to the mews in Little Ryder Street, where my uncle stabled
his horses.&nbsp; The groom was away, and I had to send a lad in
search of him, while with the help of the livery-man I dragged
the curricle from the coach-house and brought the two mares out
of their stalls.&nbsp; It was half an hour, or possibly
three-quarters, before everything had been found, and Lorimer was
already waiting in Jermyn Street with the inevitable baskets,
whilst my uncle stood in the open door of his house, clad in his
long fawn-coloured driving-coat, with no sign upon his calm pale
face of the tumult of impatience which must, I was sure, be
raging within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall leave you, Lorimer,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We might find it hard to get a bed for you.&nbsp; Keep at
her head, William!&nbsp; Jump in, nephew.&nbsp; Halloa, Warr,
what is the matter now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prizefighter was hastening towards us as fast as his bulk
would allow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one word before you go, Sir Charles,&rdquo; he
panted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just &rsquo;eard in my taproom
that the four men I spoke of left for Crawley at one
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, Warr,&rdquo; said my uncle, with his foot
upon the step.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the odds &rsquo;ave risen to ten to one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go her head, William!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just one more word, gov&rsquo;nor.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll
excuse the liberty, but if I was you I&rsquo;d take my pistols
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you; I have them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The long thong cracked between the ears of the leader, the
groom sprang for the pavement, and Jermyn Street had changed for
St. James&rsquo;s, and that again for Whitehall with a swiftness
which showed that the gallant mares were as impatient as their
master.&nbsp; It was half-past four by the Parliament clock as we
flew on to Westminster Bridge.&nbsp; There was the flash of water
beneath us, and then we were between those two long dun-coloured
lines of houses which had been the avenue which had led us to
London.&nbsp; My uncle sat with tightened lips and a brooding
brow.&nbsp; We had reached Streatham before he broke the
silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a good deal at stake, nephew,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So have I, sir,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; he cried, in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, I had forgot.&nbsp; You have some
eccentricities, after all, nephew.&nbsp; You are a faithful
friend, which is a rare enough thing in our circles.&nbsp; I
never had but one friend of my own position, and he&mdash;but
you&rsquo;ve heard me tell the story.&nbsp; I fear it will be
dark before we reach Crawley.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear that it will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case we may be too late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray God not, sir!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sit behind the best cattle in England, but I fear
lest we find the roads blocked before we get to Crawley.&nbsp;
Did you observe, nephew, that these four villains spoke in
Warr&rsquo;s hearing of the master who was behind them, and who
was paying them for their infamy?&nbsp; Did you not understand
that they were hired to cripple my man?&nbsp; Who, then, could
have hired them?&nbsp; Who had an interest unless it was&mdash;I
know Sir Lothian Hume to be a desperate man.&nbsp; I know that he
has had heavy card losses at Watier&rsquo;s and
White&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I know also that he has much at stake upon
this event, and that he has plunged upon it with a rashness which
made his friends think that he had some private reason for being
satisfied as to the result.&nbsp; By Heaven, it all hangs
together!&nbsp; If it should be so&mdash;!&rdquo;&nbsp; He
relapsed into silence, but I saw the same look of cold fierceness
settle upon his features which I had marked there when he and Sir
John Lade had raced wheel to wheel down the Godstone road.</p>
<p>The sun sank slowly towards the low Surrey hills, and the
shadows crept steadily eastwards, but the whirr of the wheels and
the roar of the hoofs never slackened.&nbsp; A fresh wind blew
upon our faces, while the young leaves drooped motionless from
the wayside branches.&nbsp; The golden edge of the sun was just
sinking behind the oaks of Reigate Hill when the dripping mares
drew up before the Crown at Redhill.&nbsp; The landlord, an old
sportsman and ringsider, ran out to greet so well-known a
Corinthian as Sir Charles Tregellis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know Berks, the bruiser?&rdquo; asked my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he passed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir Charles.&nbsp; It may have been about four
o&rsquo;clock, though with this crowd of folk and carriages
it&rsquo;s hard to swear to it.&nbsp; There was him, and Red Ike,
and Fighting Yussef the Jew, and another, with a good bit of
blood betwixt the shafts.&nbsp; They&rsquo;d been driving her
hard, too, for she was all in a lather.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s ugly, nephew,&rdquo; said my uncle, when
we were flying onwards towards Reigate.&nbsp; &ldquo;If they
drove so hard, it looks as though they wished to get early to
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim and Belcher would surely be a match for the four of
them,&rdquo; I suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If Belcher were with him I should have no fear.&nbsp;
But you cannot tell what <i>diablerie</i> they may be up
to.&nbsp; Let us only find him safe and sound, and I&rsquo;ll
never lose sight of him until I see him in the ring.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ll sit up on guard with our pistols, nephew, and I only
trust that these villains may be indiscreet enough to attempt
it.&nbsp; But they must have been very sure of success before
they put the odds up to such a figure, and it is that which
alarms me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But surely they have nothing to win by such villainy,
sir?&nbsp; If they were to hurt Jim Harrison the battle could not
be fought, and the bets would not be decided.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would be in an ordinary prize-battle, nephew; and
it is fortunate that it should be so, or the rascals who infest
the ring would soon make all sport impossible.&nbsp; But here it
is different.&nbsp; On the terms of the wager I lose unless I can
produce a man, within the prescribed ages, who can beat Crab
Wilson.&nbsp; You must remember that I have never named my
man.&nbsp; <i>C&rsquo;est dommage</i>, but so it is!&nbsp; We
know who it is and so do our opponents, but the referees and
stakeholder would take no notice of that.&nbsp; If we complain
that Jim Harrison has been crippled, they would answer that they
have no official knowledge that Jim Harrison was our
nominee.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s play or pay, and the villains are
taking advantage of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle&rsquo;s fears as to our being blocked upon the road
were only too well founded, for after we passed Reigate there was
such a procession of every sort of vehicle, that I believe for
the whole eight miles there was not a horse whose nose was
further than a few feet from the back of the curricle or barouche
in front.&nbsp; Every road leading from London, as well as those
from Guildford in the west and Tunbridge in the east, had
contributed their stream of four-in-hands, gigs, and mounted
sportsmen, until the whole broad Brighton highway was choked from
ditch to ditch with a laughing, singing, shouting throng, all
flowing in the same direction.&nbsp; No man who looked upon that
motley crowd could deny that, for good or evil, the love of the
ring was confined to no class, but was a national peculiarity,
deeply seated in the English nature, and a common heritage of the
young aristocrat in his drag and of the rough costers sitting six
deep in their pony cart.&nbsp; There I saw statesmen and
soldiers, noblemen and lawyers, farmers and squires, with roughs
of the East End and yokels of the shires, all toiling along with
the prospect of a night of discomfort before them, on the chance
of seeing a fight which might, for all that they knew, be decided
in a single round.&nbsp; A more cheery and hearty set of people
could not be imagined, and the chaff flew about as thick as the
dust clouds, while at every wayside inn the landlord and the
drawers would be out with trays of foam-headed tankards to
moisten those importunate throats.&nbsp; The ale-drinking, the
rude good-fellowship, the heartiness, the laughter at
discomforts, the craving to see the fight&mdash;all these may be
set down as vulgar and trivial by those to whom they are
distasteful; but to me, listening to the far-off and uncertain
echoes of our distant past, they seem to have been the very bones
upon which much that is most solid and virile in this ancient
race was moulded.</p>
<p>But, alas for our chance of hastening onwards!&nbsp; Even my
uncle&rsquo;s skill could not pick a passage through that moving
mass.&nbsp; We could but fall into our places and be content to
snail along from Reigate to Horley and on to Povey Cross and over
Lowfield Heath, while day shaded away into twilight, and that
deepened into night.&nbsp; At Kimberham Bridge the carriage-lamps
were all lit, and it was wonderful, where the road curved
downwards before us, to see this writhing serpent with the golden
scales crawling before us in the darkness.&nbsp; And then, at
last, we saw the formless mass of the huge Crawley elm looming
before us in the gloom, and there was the broad village street
with the glimmer of the cottage windows, and the high front of
the old George Inn, glowing from every door and pane and crevice,
in honour of the noble company who were to sleep within that
night.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">FOUL PLAY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> uncle&rsquo;s impatience would
not suffer him to wait for the slow rotation which would bring us
to the door, but he flung the reins and a crown-piece to one of
the rough fellows who thronged the side-walk, and pushing his way
vigorously through the crowd, he made for the entrance.&nbsp; As
he came within the circle of light thrown by the windows, a
whisper ran round as to who this masterful gentleman with the
pale face and the driving-coat might be, and a lane was formed to
admit us.&nbsp; I had never before understood the popularity of
my uncle in the sporting world, for the folk began to huzza as we
passed with cries of &ldquo;Hurrah for Buck Tregellis!&nbsp; Good
luck to you and your man, Sir Charles!&nbsp; Clear a path for a
bang-up noble Corinthian!&rdquo; whilst the landlord, attracted
by the shouting, came running out to greet us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Sir Charles!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hope I see you well, sir, and I trust that you will find
that your man does credit to the George.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; asked my uncle, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never better, sir.&nbsp; Looks a picture, he
does&mdash;and fit to fight for a kingdom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle gave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone to his room early, sir, seein&rsquo;
that he had some very partic&rsquo;lar business to-morrow
mornin&rsquo;,&rdquo; said the landlord, grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Belcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here he is, in the bar parlour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened a door as he spoke, and looking in we saw a score of
well-dressed men, some of whose faces had become familiar to me
during my short West End career, seated round a table upon which
stood a steaming soup-tureen filled with punch.&nbsp; At the
further end, very much at his ease amongst the aristocrats and
exquisites who surrounded him, sat the Champion of England, his
superb figure thrown back in his chair, a flush upon his handsome
face, and a loose red handkerchief knotted carelessly round his
throat in the picturesque fashion which was long known by his
name.&nbsp; Half a century has passed since then, and I have seen
my share of fine men.&nbsp; Perhaps it is because I am a slight
creature myself, but it is my peculiarity that I had rather look
upon a splendid man than upon any work of Nature.&nbsp; Yet
during all that time I have never seen a finer man than Jim
Belcher, and if I wish to match him in my memory, I can only turn
to that other Jim whose fate and fortunes I am trying to lay
before you.</p>
<p>There was a shout of jovial greeting when my uncle&rsquo;s
face was seen in the doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Tregellis!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;We were
expecting you!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a devilled
bladebone ordered.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the latest
from London?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the meaning of the long
odds against your man?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have the folk gone
mad?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;What the devil is it all
about?&rdquo;&nbsp; They were all talking at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, gentlemen,&rdquo; my uncle answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall be happy to give you any information in my power a
little later.&nbsp; I have a matter of some slight importance to
decide.&nbsp; Belcher, I would have a word with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Champion came out with us into the passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your man, Belcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone to his room, sir.&nbsp; I believe that he
should have a clear twelve hours&rsquo; sleep before
fighting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of day has he had?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did him lightly in the matter of exercise.&nbsp;
Clubs, dumbbells, walking, and a half-hour with the
mufflers.&nbsp; He&rsquo;ll do us all proud, sir, or I&rsquo;m a
Dutchman!&nbsp; But what in the world&rsquo;s amiss with the
betting?&nbsp; If I didn&rsquo;t know that he was as straight as
a line, I&rsquo;d ha&rsquo; thought he was planning a cross and
laying against himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about that I&rsquo;ve hurried down.&nbsp; I
have good information, Belcher, that there has been a plot to
cripple him, and that the rogues are so sure of success that they
are prepared to lay anything against his appearance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belcher whistled between his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen no sign of anything of the kind,
sir.&nbsp; No one has been near him or had speech with him,
except only your nephew there and myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four villains, with Berks at their head, got the start
of us by several hours.&nbsp; It was Warr who told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Bill Warr says is straight, and what Joe Berks
does is crooked.&nbsp; Who were the others, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Red Ike, Fighting Yussef, and Chris
McCarthy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty gang, too!&nbsp; Well, sir, the lad is safe,
but it would be as well, perhaps, for one or other of us to stay
in his room with him.&nbsp; For my own part, as long as
he&rsquo;s my charge I&rsquo;m never very far away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pity to wake him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can hardly be asleep with all this racket in the
house.&nbsp; This way, sir, and down the passage!&rdquo;</p>
<p>We passed along the low-roofed, devious corridors of the
old-fashioned inn to the back of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is my room, sir,&rdquo; said Belcher, nodding to a
door upon the right.&nbsp; &ldquo;This one upon the left is
his.&rdquo;&nbsp; He threw it open as he spoke.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Sir Charles Tregellis come to see you,
Jim,&rdquo; said he; and then, &ldquo;Good Lord, what is the
meaning of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The little chamber lay before us brightly illuminated by a
brass lamp which stood upon the table.&nbsp; The bedclothes had
not been turned down, but there was an indentation upon the
counterpane which showed that some one had lain there.&nbsp;
One-half of the lattice window was swinging on its hinge, and a
cloth cap lying upon the table was the only sign of the
occupant.&nbsp; My uncle looked round him and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems that we are too late,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his cap, sir.&nbsp; Where in the world can
he have gone to with his head bare?&nbsp; I thought he was safe
in his bed an hour ago.&nbsp; Jim!&nbsp; Jim!&rdquo; he
shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has certainly gone through the window,&rdquo; cried
my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe these villains have enticed him
out by some devilish device of their own.&nbsp; Hold the lamp,
nephew.&nbsp; Ha!&nbsp; I thought so.&nbsp; Here are his
footmarks upon the flower-bed outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlord, and one or two of the Corinthians from the
bar-parlour, had followed us to the back of the house.&nbsp; Some
one had opened the side door, and we found ourselves in the
kitchen garden, where, clustering upon the gravel path, we were
able to hold the lamp over the soft, newly turned earth which lay
between us and the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s his footmark!&rdquo; said Belcher.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He wore his running boots this evening, and you can see
the nails.&nbsp; But what&rsquo;s this?&nbsp; Some one else has
been here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A woman!&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Heaven, you&rsquo;re right, nephew,&rdquo; said my
uncle.</p>
<p>Belcher gave a hearty curse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He never had a word to say to any girl in the
village.&nbsp; I took partic&rsquo;lar notice of that.&nbsp; And
to think of them coming in like this at the last
moment!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear as possible, Tregellis,&rdquo; said
the Hon. Berkeley Craven, who was one of the company from the
bar-parlour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whoever it was came outside the window
and tapped.&nbsp; You see here, and here, the small feet have
their toes to the house, while the others are all leading
away.&nbsp; She came to summon him, and he followed
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is perfectly certain,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s not a moment to be lost.&nbsp; We must
divide and search in different directions, unless we can get some
clue as to where they have gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s only the one path out of the
garden,&rdquo; cried the landlord, leading the way.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It opens out into this back lane, which leads up to the
stables.&nbsp; The other end of the lane goes out into the side
road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bright yellow glare from a stable lantern cut a ring
suddenly from the darkness, and an ostler came lounging out of
the yard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried the landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, master!&nbsp; Bill Shields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have you been there, Bill?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, master, I&rsquo;ve been in an&rsquo; out of the
stables this hour back.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t pack in another
&rsquo;orse, and there&rsquo;s no use tryin&rsquo;.&nbsp; I
daren&rsquo;t &rsquo;ardly give them their feed, for, if they was
to thicken out just ever so little&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Bill.&nbsp; Be careful how you answer, for a
mistake may cost you your place.&nbsp; Have you seen any one pass
down the lane?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was a feller in a rabbit-skin cap some time
ago.&nbsp; &rsquo;E was loiterin&rsquo; about until I asked
&rsquo;im what &rsquo;is business was, for I didn&rsquo;t care
about the looks of &rsquo;im, or the way that &rsquo;e was
peepin&rsquo; in at the windows.&nbsp; I turned the stable
lantern on to &rsquo;im, but &rsquo;e ducked &rsquo;is face,
an&rsquo; I could only swear to &rsquo;is red
&rsquo;ead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I cast a quick glance at my uncle, and I saw that the shadow
had deepened upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What became of him?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;E slouched away, sir, an&rsquo; I saw the last
of &rsquo;im.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve seen no one else?&nbsp; You didn&rsquo;t,
for example, see a woman and a man pass down the lane
together?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or hear anything unusual?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, now that you mention it, sir, I did &rsquo;ear
somethin&rsquo;; but on a night like this, when all these London
blades are in the village&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it, then?&rdquo; cried my uncle,
impatiently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, it was a kind of a cry out yonder as if some
one &rsquo;ad got &rsquo;imself into trouble.&nbsp; I thought,
maybe, two sparks were fightin&rsquo;, and I took no
partic&rsquo;lar notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did it come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;From the side road, yonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it distant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir; I should say it didn&rsquo;t come from
more&rsquo;n two hundred yards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A single cry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a kind of screech, sir, and then I
&rsquo;eard somebody drivin&rsquo; very &rsquo;ard down the
road.&nbsp; I remember thinking that it was strange that any one
should be driving away from Crawley on a great night like
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle seized the lantern from the fellow&rsquo;s hand, and
we all trooped behind him down the lane.&nbsp; At the further end
the road cut it across at right angles.&nbsp; Down this my uncle
hastened, but his search was not a long one, for the glaring
light fell suddenly upon something which brought a groan to my
lips and a bitter curse to those of Jem Belcher.&nbsp; Along the
white surface of the dusty highway there was drawn a long smear
of crimson, while beside this ominous stain there lay a murderous
little pocket-bludgeon, such as Warr had described in the
morning.</p>
<h2><a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>CHAPTER XVI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CRAWLEY DOWNS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> through that weary night my
uncle and I, with Belcher, Berkeley Craven, and a dozen of the
Corinthians, searched the country side for some trace of our
missing man, but save for that ill-boding splash upon the road
not the slightest clue could be obtained as to what had befallen
him.&nbsp; No one had seen or heard anything of him, and the
single cry in the night of which the ostler told us was the only
indication of the tragedy which had taken place.&nbsp; In small
parties we scoured the country as far as East Grinstead and
Bletchingley, and the sun had been long over the horizon before
we found ourselves back at Crawley once more with heavy hearts
and tired feet.&nbsp; My uncle, who had driven to Reigate in the
hope of gaining some intelligence, did not return until past
seven o&rsquo;clock, and a glance at his face gave us the same
black news which he gathered from ours.</p>
<p>We held a council round our dismal breakfast-table, to which
Mr. Berkeley Craven was invited as a man of sound wisdom and
large experience in matters of sport.&nbsp; Belcher was half
frenzied by this sudden ending of all the pains which he had
taken in the training, and could only rave out threats at Berks
and his companions, with terrible menaces as to what he would do
when he met them.&nbsp; My uncle sat grave and thoughtful, eating
nothing and drumming his fingers upon the table, while my heart
was heavy within me, and I could have sunk my face into my hands
and burst into tears as I thought how powerless I was to aid my
friend.&nbsp; Mr. Craven, a fresh-faced, alert man of the world,
was the only one of us who seemed to preserve both his wits and
his appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me see!&nbsp; The fight was to be at ten, was it
not?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say it will be, too.&nbsp; Never say die,
Tregellis!&nbsp; Your man has still three hours in which to come
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The villains have done their work too well for that, I
fear,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, now, let us reason it out,&rdquo; said Berkeley
Craven.&nbsp; &ldquo;A woman comes and she coaxes this young man
out of his room.&nbsp; Do you know any young woman who had an
influence over him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle looked at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know of
none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we know that she came,&rdquo; said Berkeley
Craven.&nbsp; &ldquo;There can be no question as to that.&nbsp;
She brought some piteous tale, no doubt, such as a gallant young
man could hardly refuse to listen to.&nbsp; He fell into the
trap, and allowed himself to be decoyed to the place where these
rascals were waiting for him.&nbsp; We may take all that as
proved, I should fancy, Tregellis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see no better explanation,&rdquo; said my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, it is obviously not the interest of these
men to kill him.&nbsp; Warr heard them say as much.&nbsp; They
could not make sure, perhaps, of doing so tough a young fellow an
injury which would certainly prevent him from fighting.&nbsp;
Even with a broken arm he might pull the fight off, as men have
done before.&nbsp; There was too much money on for them to run
any risks.&nbsp; They gave him a tap on the head, therefore, to
prevent his making too much resistance, and they then drove him
off to some farmhouse or stable, where they will hold him a
prisoner until the time for the fight is over.&nbsp; I warrant
that you see him before to-night as well as ever he
was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This theory sounded so reasonable that it seemed to lift a
little of the weight from my heart, but I could see that from my
uncle&rsquo;s point of view it was a poor consolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare say you are right, Craven,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure that I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it won&rsquo;t help us to win the fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the point, sir,&rdquo; cried
Belcher.&nbsp; &ldquo;By the Lord, I wish they&rsquo;d let me
take his place, even with my left arm strapped behind
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should advise you in any case to go to the
ringside,&rdquo; said Craven.&nbsp; &ldquo;You should hold on
until the last moment in the hope of your man turning
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall certainly do so.&nbsp; And I shall protest
against paying the wagers under such circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Craven shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember the conditions of the match,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I fear it is pay or play.&nbsp; No doubt the
point might be submitted to the referees, but I cannot doubt that
they would have to give it against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We had sunk into a melancholy silence, when suddenly Belcher
sprang up from the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Listen to
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; we cried, all three.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The betting!&nbsp; Listen again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Out of the babel of voices and roaring of wheels outside the
window a single sentence struck sharply on our ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even money upon Sir Charles&rsquo;s nominee!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even money!&rdquo; cried my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was
seven to one against me, yesterday.&nbsp; What is the meaning of
this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even money either way,&rdquo; cried the voice
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s somebody knows something,&rdquo; said
Belcher, &ldquo;and there&rsquo;s nobody has a better right to
know what it is than we.&nbsp; Come on, sir, and we&rsquo;ll get
to the bottom of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The village street was packed with people, for they had been
sleeping twelve and fifteen in a room, whilst hundreds of
gentlemen had spent the night in their carriages.&nbsp; So thick
was the throng that it was no easy matter to get out of the
George.&nbsp; A drunken man, snoring horribly in his breathing,
was curled up in the passage, absolutely oblivious to the stream
of people who flowed round and occasionally over him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the betting, boys?&rdquo; asked Belcher,
from the steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even money, Jim,&rdquo; cried several voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was long odds on Wilson when last I
heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but there came a man who laid freely the other
way, and he started others taking the odds, until now you can get
even money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who started it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that&rsquo;s he!&nbsp; The man that lies drunk in
the passage.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s been pouring it down like water
ever since he drove in at six o&rsquo;clock, so it&rsquo;s no
wonder he&rsquo;s like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Belcher stooped down and turned over the man&rsquo;s inert
head so as to show his features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a stranger to me, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to me,&rdquo; added my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not to me,&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
John Cumming, the landlord of the inn at Friar&rsquo;s Oak.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve known him ever since I was a boy, and I can&rsquo;t be
mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what the devil can <i>he</i> know about
it?&rdquo; said Craven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing at all, in all probability,&rdquo; answered my
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is backing young Jim because he knows him,
and because he has more brandy than sense.&nbsp; His drunken
confidence set others to do the same, and so the odds came
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was as sober as a judge when he drove in here this
morning,&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; &ldquo;He began backing
Sir Charles&rsquo;s nominee from the moment he arrived.&nbsp;
Some of the other boys took the office from him, and they very
soon brought the odds down amongst them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he had not brought himself down as well,&rdquo;
said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I beg that you will bring me a little
lavender water, landlord, for the smell of this crowd is
appalling.&nbsp; I suppose you could not get any sense from this
drunken fellow, nephew, or find out what it is he
knows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was in vain that I rocked him by the shoulder and shouted
his name in his ear.&nbsp; Nothing could break in upon that
serene intoxication.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s a unique situation as far as my
experience goes,&rdquo; said Berkeley Craven.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here
we are within a couple of hours of the fight, and yet you
don&rsquo;t know whether you have a man to represent you.&nbsp; I
hope you don&rsquo;t stand to lose very much,
Tregellis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle shrugged his shoulders carelessly, and took a pinch
of his snuff with that inimitable sweeping gesture which no man
has ever ventured to imitate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty well, my boy!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
it is time that we thought of going up to the Downs.&nbsp; This
night journey has left me just a little <i>effleur&eacute;</i>,
and I should like half an hour of privacy to arrange my
toilet.&nbsp; If this is my last kick, it shall at least be with
a well-brushed boot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have heard a traveller from the wilds of America say that he
looked upon the Red Indian and the English gentleman as closely
akin, citing the passion for sport, the aloofness and the
suppression of the emotions in each.&nbsp; I thought of his words
as I watched my uncle that morning, for I believe that no victim
tied to the stake could have had a worse outlook before
him.&nbsp; It was not merely that his own fortunes were largely
at stake, but it was the dreadful position in which he would
stand before this immense concourse of people, many of whom had
put their money upon his judgment, if he should find himself at
the last moment with an impotent excuse instead of a champion to
put before them.&nbsp; What a situation for a man who prided
himself upon his aplomb, and upon bringing all that he undertook
to the very highest standard of success!&nbsp; I, who knew him
well, could tell from his wan cheeks and his restless fingers
that he was at his wit&rsquo;s ends what to do; but no stranger
who observed his jaunty bearing, the flecking of his laced
handkerchief, the handling of his quizzing glass, or the shooting
of his ruffles, would ever have thought that this butterfly
creature could have had a care upon earth.</p>
<p>It was close upon nine o&rsquo;clock when we were ready to
start for the Downs, and by that time my uncle&rsquo;s curricle
was almost the only vehicle left in the village street.&nbsp; The
night before they had lain with their wheels interlocking and
their shafts under each other&rsquo;s bodies, as thick as they
could fit, from the old church to the Crawley Elm, spanning the
road five-deep for a good half-mile in length.&nbsp; Now the grey
village street lay before us almost deserted save by a few women
and children.&nbsp; Men, horses, carriages&mdash;all were
gone.&nbsp; My uncle drew on his driving-gloves and arranged his
costume with punctilious neatness; but I observed that he glanced
up and down the road with a haggard and yet expectant eye before
he took his seat.&nbsp; I sat behind with Belcher, while the Hon.
Berkeley Craven took the place beside him.</p>
<p>The road from Crawley curves gently upwards to the upland
heather-clad plateau which extends for many miles in every
direction.&nbsp; Strings of pedestrians, most of them so weary
and dust-covered that it was evident that they had walked the
thirty miles from London during the night, were plodding along by
the sides of the road or trailing over the long mottled slopes of
the moorland.&nbsp; A horseman, fantastically dressed in green
and splendidly mounted, was waiting at the crossroads, and as he
spurred towards us I recognised the dark, handsome face and bold
black eyes of Mendoza.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am waiting here to give the office, Sir
Charles,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s down the
Grinstead road, half a mile to the left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; said my uncle, reining his mares
round into the cross-road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t got your man there,&rdquo; remarked
Mendoza, with something of suspicion in his manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil is that to you?&rdquo; cried Belcher,
furiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a good deal to all of us, for there are some
funny stories about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep them to yourself, then, or you may wish you
had never heard them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, Jem!&nbsp; Your breakfast don&rsquo;t seem
to have agreed with you this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the others arrived?&rdquo; asked my uncle,
carelessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, Sir Charles.&nbsp; But Tom Oliver is there
with the ropes and stakes.&nbsp; Jackson drove by just now, and
most of the ring-keepers are up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have still an hour,&rdquo; remarked my uncle, as he
drove on.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is possible that the others may be
late, since they have to come from Reigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take it like a man, Tregellis,&rdquo; said
Craven.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must keep a bold face and brazen it out
until the last moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, sir,&rdquo; cried Belcher.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never believe the betting would rise like that
if somebody didn&rsquo;t know something.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll hold
on by our teeth and nails, Sir Charles, and see what comes of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We could hear a sound like the waves upon the beach, long
before we came in sight of that mighty multitude, and then at
last, on a sudden dip of the road, we saw it lying before us, a
whirlpool of humanity with an open vortex in the centre.&nbsp;
All round, the thousands of carriages and horses were dotted over
the moor, and the slopes were gay with tents and booths.&nbsp; A
spot had been chosen for the ring, where a great basin had been
hollowed out in the ground, so that all round that natural
amphitheatre a crowd of thirty thousand people could see very
well what was going on in the centre.&nbsp; As we drove up a buzz
of greeting came from the people upon the fringe which was
nearest to us, spreading and spreading, until the whole multitude
had joined in the acclamation.&nbsp; Then an instant later a
second shout broke forth, beginning from the other side of the
arena, and the faces which had been turned towards us whisked
round, so that in a twinkling the whole foreground changed from
white to dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s they.&nbsp; They are in time,&rdquo; said my
uncle and Craven together.</p>
<p>Standing up on our curricle, we could see the cavalcade
approaching over the Downs.&nbsp; In front came a huge yellow
barouche, in which sat Sir Lothian Hume, Crab Wilson, and Captain
Barclay, his trainer.&nbsp; The postillions were flying
canary-yellow ribands from their caps, those being the colours
under which Wilson was to fight.&nbsp; Behind the carriage there
rode a hundred or more noblemen and gentlemen of the west
country, and then a line of gigs, tilburies, and carriages wound
away down the Grinstead road as far as our eyes could follow
it.&nbsp; The big barouche came lumbering over the sward in our
direction until Sir Lothian Hume caught sight of us, when he
shouted to his postillions to pull up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good morning, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said he, springing
out of the carriage.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought I knew your scarlet
curricle.&nbsp; We have an excellent morning for the
battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle bowed coldly, and made no answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose that since we are all here we may begin at
once,&rdquo; said Sir Lothian, taking no notice of the
other&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We begin at ten o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Not an instant
before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good, if you prefer it.&nbsp; By the way, Sir
Charles, where is your man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would ask <i>you</i> that question, Sir
Lothian,&rdquo; answered my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is my
man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A look of astonishment passed over Sir Lothian&rsquo;s
features, which, if it were not real, was most admirably
affected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by asking me such a
question?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I wish to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how can I tell, and what business is it of
mine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have reason to believe that you have made it your
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you would kindly put the matter a little more
clearly there would be some possibility of my understanding
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were both very white and cold, formal and unimpassioned
in their bearing, but exchanging glances which crossed like
rapier blades.&nbsp; I thought of Sir Lothian&rsquo;s murderous
repute as a duellist, and I trembled for my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, sir, if you imagine that you have a grievance
against me, you will oblige me vastly by putting it into
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;There has
been a conspiracy to maim or kidnap my man, and I have every
reason to believe that you are privy to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An ugly sneer came over Sir Lothian&rsquo;s saturnine
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your man has not
come on quite as well as you had expected in his training, and
you are hard put to it to invent an excuse.&nbsp; Still, I should
have thought that you might have found a more probable one, and
one which would entail less serious consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; answered my uncle, &ldquo;you are a liar,
but how great a liar you are nobody knows save
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Lothian&rsquo;s hollow cheeks grew white with passion, and
I saw for an instant in his deep-set eyes such a glare as comes
from the frenzied hound rearing and ramping at the end of its
chain.&nbsp; Then, with an effort, he became the same cold, hard,
self-contained man as ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not become our position to quarrel like two
yokels at a fair,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;we shall go further into
the matter afterwards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you that we shall,&rdquo; answered my uncle,
grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meanwhile, I hold you to the terms of your wager.&nbsp;
Unless you produce your nominee within five-and-twenty minutes, I
claim the match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight-and-twenty minutes,&rdquo; said my uncle, looking
at his watch.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may claim it then, but not an
instant before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was admirable at that moment, for his manner was that of a
man with all sorts of hidden resources, so that I could hardly
make myself realize as I looked at him that our position was
really as desperate as I knew it to be.&nbsp; In the meantime
Berkeley Craven, who had been exchanging a few words with Sir
Lothian Hume, came back to our side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been asked to be sole referee in this
matter,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Does that meet with your
wishes, Sir Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be vastly obliged to you, Craven, if you will
undertake the duties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And Jackson has been suggested as
timekeeper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not wish a better one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good.&nbsp; That is settled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meantime the last of the carriages had come up, and the
horses had all been picketed upon the moor.&nbsp; The stragglers
who had dotted the grass had closed in until the huge crowd was
one unit with a single mighty voice, which was already beginning
to bellow its impatience.&nbsp; Looking round, there was hardly a
moving object upon the whole vast expanse of green and purple
down.&nbsp; A belated gig was coming at full gallop down the road
which led from the south, and a few pedestrians were still
trailing up from Crawley, but nowhere was there a sign of the
missing man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The betting keeps up for all that,&rdquo; said
Belcher.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just been to the ring-side, and
it is still even.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a place for you at the outer ropes, Sir
Charles,&rdquo; said Craven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no sign of my man yet.&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
come in until he arrives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my duty to tell you that only ten minutes are
left.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make it five,&rdquo; cried Sir Lothian Hume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a question which lies with the referee,&rdquo;
said Craven, firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;My watch makes it ten minutes,
and ten it must be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s Crab Wilson!&rdquo; cried Belcher, and at
the same moment a shout like a thunderclap burst from the
crowd.&nbsp; The west countryman had emerged from his
dressing-tent, followed by Dutch Sam and Tom Owen, who were
acting as his seconds.&nbsp; He was nude to the waist, with a
pair of white calico drawers, white silk stockings, and running
shoes.&nbsp; Round his middle was a canary-yellow sash, and
dainty little ribbons of the same colour fluttered from the sides
of his knees.&nbsp; He carried a high white hat in his hand, and
running down the lane which had been kept open through the crowd
to allow persons to reach the ring, he threw the hat high into
the air, so that it fell within the staked inclosure.&nbsp; Then
with a double spring he cleared the outer and inner line of rope,
and stood with his arms folded in the centre.</p>
<p>I do not wonder that the people cheered.&nbsp; Even Belcher
could not help joining in the general shout of applause.&nbsp; He
was certainly a splendidly built young athlete, and one could not
have wished to look upon a finer sight as his white skin, sleek
and luminous as a panther&rsquo;s, gleamed in the light of the
morning sun, with a beautiful liquid rippling of muscles at every
movement.&nbsp; His arms were long and slingy, his shoulders
loose and yet powerful, with the downward slant which is a surer
index of power than squareness can be.&nbsp; He clasped his hands
behind his head, threw them aloft, and swung them backwards, and
at every movement some fresh expanse of his smooth, white skin
became knobbed and gnarled with muscles, whilst a yell of
admiration and delight from the crowd greeted each fresh
exhibition.&nbsp; Then, folding his arms once more, he stood like
a beautiful statue waiting for his antagonist.</p>
<p>Sir Lothian Hume had been looking impatiently at his watch,
and now he shut it with a triumphant snap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
match is forfeit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time is not up,&rdquo; said Craven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have still five minutes.&rdquo;&nbsp; My uncle looked
round with despairing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only three, Tregellis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deep angry murmur was rising from the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cross!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a cross!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a fake!&rdquo; was the cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two minutes, Tregellis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s your man, Sir Charles?&nbsp;
Where&rsquo;s the man that we have backed?&rdquo;&nbsp; Flushed
faces began to crane over each other, and angry eyes glared up at
us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more minute, Tregellis!&nbsp; I am very sorry, but
it will be my duty to declare it forfeit against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a sudden swirl in the crowd, a rush, a shout, and
high up in the air there spun an old black hat, floating over the
heads of the ring-siders and flickering down within the
ropes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saved, by the Lord!&rdquo; screamed Belcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I rather fancy,&rdquo; said my uncle, calmly,
&ldquo;that this must be my man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too late!&rdquo; cried Sir Lothian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; answered the referee.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was
still twenty seconds to the hour.&nbsp; The fight will now
proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE RING-SIDE.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Out</span> of the whole of that vast
multitude I was one of the very few who had observed whence it
was that this black hat, skimming so opportunely over the ropes,
had come.&nbsp; I have already remarked that when we looked
around us there had been a single gig travelling very rapidly
upon the southern road.&nbsp; My uncle&rsquo;s eyes had rested
upon it, but his attention had been drawn away by the discussion
between Sir Lothian Hume and the referee upon the question of
time.&nbsp; For my own part, I had been so struck by the furious
manner in which these belated travellers were approaching, that I
had continued to watch them with all sorts of vague hopes within
me, which I did not dare to put into words for fear of adding to
my uncle&rsquo;s disappointments.&nbsp; I had just made out that
the gig contained a man and a woman, when suddenly I saw it
swerve off the road, and come with a galloping horse and bounding
wheels right across the moor, crashing through the gorse bushes,
and sinking down to the hubs in the heather and bracken.&nbsp; As
the driver pulled up his foam-spattered horse, he threw the reins
to his companion, sprang from his seat, butted furiously into the
crowd, and then an instant afterwards up went the hat which told
of his challenge and defiance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no hurry now, I presume, Craven,&rdquo; said
my uncle, as coolly as if this sudden effect had been carefully
devised by him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that your man has his hat in the ring you can take
as much time as you like, Sir Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend has certainly cut it rather fine,
nephew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not Jim, sir,&rdquo; I whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is some one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle&rsquo;s eyebrows betrayed his astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some one else!&rdquo; he ejaculated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And a good man too!&rdquo; roared Belcher, slapping his
thigh with a crack like a pistol-shot.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, blow my
dickey if it ain&rsquo;t old Jack Harrison himself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking down at the crowd, we had seen the head and shoulders
of a powerful and strenuous man moving slowly forward, and
leaving behind him a long V-shaped ripple upon its surface like
the wake of a swimming dog.&nbsp; Now, as he pushed his way
through the looser fringe the head was raised, and there was the
grinning, hardy face of the smith looking up at us.&nbsp; He had
left his hat in the ring, and was enveloped in an overcoat with a
blue bird&rsquo;s-eye handkerchief tied round his neck.&nbsp; As
he emerged from the throng he let his great-coat fly loose, and
showed that he was dressed in his full fighting kit&mdash;black
drawers, chocolate stockings, and white shoes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m right sorry to be so late, Sir
Charles,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d have been
sooner, but it took me a little time to make it all straight with
the missus.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t convince her all at once,
an&rsquo; so I brought her with me, and we argued it out on the
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking at the gig, I saw that it was indeed Mrs. Harrison who
was seated in it.&nbsp; Sir Charles beckoned him up to the wheel
of the curricle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in the world brings you here, Harrison?&rdquo; he
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am as glad to see you as ever I was to
see a man in my life, but I confess that I did not expect
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, you heard I was coming,&rdquo; said the
smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I did not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t you get a message, Sir Charles, from a man
named Cumming, landlord of the Friar&rsquo;s Oak Inn?&nbsp;
Mister Rodney there would know him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw him dead drunk at the George.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There, now, if I wasn&rsquo;t afraid of it!&rdquo;
cried Harrison, angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s always like that
when he&rsquo;s excited, and I never saw a man more off his head
than he was when he heard I was going to take this job
over.&nbsp; He brought a bag of sovereigns up with him to back me
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how the betting got turned,&rdquo; said my
uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;He found others to follow his lead, it
appears.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so afraid that he might get upon the drink that I
made him promise to go straight to you, sir, the very instant he
should arrive.&nbsp; He had a note to deliver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that he reached the George at six, whilst
I did not return from Reigate until after seven, by which time I
have no doubt that he had drunk his message to me out of his
head.&nbsp; But where is your nephew Jim, and how did you come to
know that you would be needed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not his fault, I promise you, that you should be
left in the lurch.&nbsp; As to me, I had my orders to take his
place from the only man upon earth whose word I have never
disobeyed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said Mrs. Harrison, who had
left the gig and approached us.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can make the
most of it this time, for never again shall you have my
Jack&mdash;not if you were to go on your knees for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not a patron of sport, and that&rsquo;s a
fact,&rdquo; said the smith.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sport!&rdquo; she cried, with shrill contempt and
anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me when all is over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hurried away, and I saw her afterwards seated amongst the
bracken, her back turned towards the multitude, and her hands
over her ears, cowering and wincing in an agony of
apprehension.</p>
<p>Whilst this hurried scene had been taking place, the crowd had
become more and more tumultuous, partly from their impatience at
the delay, and partly from their exuberant spirits at the
unexpected chance of seeing so celebrated a fighting man as
Harrison.&nbsp; His identity had already been noised abroad, and
many an elderly connoisseur plucked his long net-purse out of his
fob, in order to put a few guineas upon the man who would
represent the school of the past against the present.&nbsp; The
younger men were still in favour of the west-countryman, and
small odds were to be had either way in proportion to the number
of the supporters of each in the different parts of the
crowd.</p>
<p>In the mean time Sir Lothian Hume had come bustling up to the
Honourable Berkeley Craven, who was still standing near our
curricle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg to lodge a formal protest against these
proceedings,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On what grounds, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because the man produced is not the original nominee of
Sir Charles Tregellis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never named one, as you are well aware,&rdquo; said
my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The betting has all been upon the understanding that
young Jim Harrison was my man&rsquo;s opponent.&nbsp; Now, at the
last moment, he is withdrawn and another and more formidable man
put into his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Charles Tregellis is quite within his
rights,&rdquo; said Craven, firmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He undertook to
produce a man who should be within the age limits stipulated, and
I understand that Harrison fulfils all the conditions.&nbsp; You
are over five-and-thirty, Harrison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty-one next month, master.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good.&nbsp; I direct that the fight
proceed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But alas! there was one authority which was higher even than
that of the referee, and we were destined to an experience which
was the prelude, and sometimes the conclusion, also, of many an
old-time fight.&nbsp; Across the moor there had ridden a
black-coated gentleman, with buff-topped hunting-boots and a
couple of grooms behind him, the little knot of horsemen showing
up clearly upon the curving swells and then dipping down into the
alternate hollows.&nbsp; Some of the more observant of the crowd
had glanced suspiciously at this advancing figure, but the
majority had not observed him at all until he reined up his horse
upon a knoll which overlooked the amphitheatre, and in a
stentorian voice announced that he represented the <i>Custos
rotulorum</i> of His Majesty&rsquo;s county of Sussex, that he
proclaimed this assembly to be gathered together for an illegal
purpose, and that he was commissioned to disperse it by force, if
necessary.</p>
<p>Never before had I understood that deep-seated fear and
wholesome respect which many centuries of bludgeoning at the
hands of the law had beaten into the fierce and turbulent natives
of these islands.&nbsp; Here was a man with two attendants upon
one side, and on the other thirty thousand very angry and
disappointed people, many of them fighters by profession, and
some from the roughest and most dangerous classes in the
country.&nbsp; And yet it was the single man who appealed
confidently to force, whilst the huge multitude swayed and
murmured like a mutinous fierce-willed creature brought face to
face with a power against which it knew that there was neither
argument nor resistance.&nbsp; My uncle, however, with Berkeley
Craven, Sir John Lade, and a dozen other lords and gentlemen,
hurried across to the interrupter of the sport.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I presume that you have a warrant, sir?&rdquo; said
Craven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir, I have a warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I have a legal right to inspect it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The magistrate handed him a blue paper which the little knot
of gentlemen clustered their heads over, for they were mostly
magistrates themselves, and were keenly alive to any possible
flaw in the wording.&nbsp; At last Craven shrugged his shoulders,
and handed it back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This seems to be correct, sir,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is entirely correct,&rdquo; answered the magistrate,
affably.&nbsp; &ldquo;To prevent waste of your valuable time,
gentlemen, I may say, once for all, that it is my unalterable
determination that no fight shall, under any circumstances, be
brought off in the county over which I have control, and I am
prepared to follow you all day in order to prevent it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To my inexperience this appeared to bring the whole matter to
a conclusion, but I had underrated the foresight of those who
arrange these affairs, and also the advantages which made Crawley
Down so favourite a rendezvous.&nbsp; There was a hurried
consultation between the principals, the backers, the referee,
and the timekeeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s seven miles to Hampshire border and about
two to Surrey,&rdquo; said Jackson.&nbsp; The famous Master of
the Ring was clad in honour of the occasion in a most resplendent
scarlet coat worked in gold at the buttonholes, a white stock, a
looped hat with a broad black band, buff knee-breeches, white
silk stockings, and paste buckles&mdash;a costume which did
justice to his magnificent figure, and especially to those famous
&ldquo;balustrade&rdquo; calves which had helped him to be the
finest runner and jumper as well as the most formidable pugilist
in England.&nbsp; His hard, high-boned face, large piercing eyes,
and immense physique made him a fitting leader for that rough and
tumultuous body who had named him as their
commander-in-chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I might venture to offer you a word of
advice,&rdquo; said the affable official, &ldquo;it would be to
make for the Hampshire line, for Sir James Ford, on the Surrey
border, has as great an objection to such assemblies as I have,
whilst Mr. Merridew, of Long Hall, who is the Hampshire
magistrate, has fewer scruples upon the point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said my uncle, raising his hat in his most
impressive manner, &ldquo;I am infinitely obliged to you.&nbsp;
With the referee&rsquo;s permission, there is nothing for it but
to shift the stakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant a scene of the wildest animation had set
in.&nbsp; Tom Owen and his assistant, Fogo, with the help of the
ring-keepers, plucked up the stakes and ropes, and carried them
off across country.&nbsp; Crab Wilson was enveloped in great
coats, and borne away in the barouche, whilst Champion Harrison
took Mr. Craven&rsquo;s place in our curricle.&nbsp; Then, off
the huge crowd started, horsemen, vehicles, and pedestrians,
rolling slowly over the broad face of the moorland.&nbsp; The
carriages rocked and pitched like boats in a seaway, as they
lumbered along, fifty abreast, scrambling and lurching over
everything which came in their way.&nbsp; Sometimes, with a snap
and a thud, one axle would come to the ground, whilst a wheel
reeled off amidst the tussocks of heather, and roars of delight
greeted the owners as they looked ruefully at the ruin.&nbsp;
Then as the gorse clumps grew thinner, and the sward more level,
those on foot began to run, the riders struck in their spurs, the
drivers cracked their whips, and away they all streamed in the
maddest, wildest cross-country steeplechase, the yellow barouche
and the crimson curricle, which held the two champions, leading
the van.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think of your chances, Harrison?&rdquo; I
heard my uncle ask, as the two mares picked their way over the
broken ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my last fight, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said the
smith.&nbsp; &ldquo;You heard the missus say that if she let me
off this time I was never to ask again.&nbsp; I must try and make
it a good one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your training?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always in training, sir.&nbsp; I work hard
from morning to night, and I drink little else than water.&nbsp;
I don&rsquo;t think that Captain Barclay can do much better with
all his rules.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s rather long in the reach for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fought and beat them that were longer.&nbsp;
If it comes to a rally I should hold my own, and I should have
the better of him at a throw.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a match of youth against experience.&nbsp;
Well, I would not hedge a guinea of my money.&nbsp; But, unless
he was acting under force, I cannot forgive young Jim for having
deserted me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He <i>was</i> acting under force, Sir
Charles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have seen him, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, master, I have not seen him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know where he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it is not for me to say one way or the
other.&nbsp; I can only tell you that he could not help
himself.&nbsp; But here&rsquo;s the beak a-comin&rsquo; for us
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ominous figure galloped up once more alongside of our
curricle, but this time his mission was a more amiable one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My jurisdiction ends at that ditch, sir,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should fancy that you could hardly wish a
better place for a mill than the sloping field beyond.&nbsp; I am
quite sure that no one will interfere with you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His anxiety that the fight should be brought off was in such
contrast to the zeal with which he had chased us from his county,
that my uncle could not help remarking upon it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not for a magistrate to wink at the breaking of
the law, sir,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But if my
colleague of Hampshire has no scruples about its being brought
off within his jurisdiction, I should very much like to see the
fight,&rdquo; with which he spurred his horse up an adjacent
knoll, from which he thought that he might gain the best view of
the proceedings.</p>
<p>And now I had a view of all those points of etiquette and
curious survivals of custom which are so recent, that we have not
yet appreciated that they may some day be as interesting to the
social historian as they then were to the sportsman.&nbsp; A
dignity was given to the contest by a rigid code of ceremony,
just as the clash of mail-clad knights was prefaced and adorned
by the calling of the heralds and the showing of blazoned
shields.&nbsp; To many in those ancient days the tourney may have
seemed a bloody and brutal ordeal, but we who look at it with
ample perspective see that it was a rude but gallant preparation
for the conditions of life in an iron age.&nbsp; And so also,
when the ring has become as extinct as the lists, we may
understand that a broader philosophy would show that all things,
which spring up so naturally and spontaneously, have a function
to fulfil, and that it is a less evil that two men should, of
their own free will, fight until they can fight no more than that
the standard of hardihood and endurance should run the slightest
risk of being lowered in a nation which depends so largely upon
the individual qualities of her citizens for her defence.&nbsp;
Do away with war, if the cursed thing can by any wit of man be
avoided, but until you see your way to that, have a care in
meddling with those primitive qualities to which at any moment
you may have to appeal for your own protection.</p>
<p>Tom Owen and his singular assistant, Fogo, who combined the
functions of prize-fighter and of poet, though, fortunately for
himself, he could use his fists better than his pen, soon had the
ring arranged according to the rules then in vogue.&nbsp; The
white wooden posts, each with the P.C. of the pugilistic club
printed upon it, were so fixed as to leave a square of 24 feet
within the roped enclosure.&nbsp; Outside this ring an outer one
was pitched, eight feet separating the two.&nbsp; The inner was
for the combatants and for their seconds, while in the outer
there were places for the referee, the timekeeper, the backers,
and a few select and fortunate individuals, of whom, through
being in my uncle&rsquo;s company, I was one.&nbsp; Some twenty
well-known prize-fighters, including my friend Bill Warr, Black
Richmond, Maddox, The Pride of Westminster, Tom Belcher,
Paddington Jones, Tough Tom Blake, Symonds the ruffian, Tyne the
tailor, and others, were stationed in the outer ring as
beaters.&nbsp; These fellows all wore the high white hats which
were at that time much affected by the fancy, and they were armed
with horse-whips, silver-mounted, and each bearing the P.C.
monogram.&nbsp; Did any one, be it East End rough or West End
patrician, intrude within the outer ropes, this corp of guardians
neither argued nor expostulated, but they fell upon the offender
and laced him with their whips until he escaped back out of the
forbidden ground.&nbsp; Even with so formidable a guard and such
fierce measures, the beaters-out, who had to check the forward
heaves of a maddened, straining crowd, were often as exhausted at
the end of a fight as the principals themselves.&nbsp; In the
mean time they formed up in a line of sentinels, presenting under
their row of white hats every type of fighting face, from the
fresh boyish countenances of Tom Belcher, Jones, and the other
younger recruits, to the scarred and mutilated visages of the
veteran bruisers.</p>
<p>Whilst the business of the fixing of the stakes and the
fastening of the ropes was going forward, I from my place of
vantage could hear the talk of the crowd behind me, the front two
rows of which were lying upon the grass, the next two kneeling,
and the others standing in serried ranks all up the side of the
gently sloping hill, so that each line could just see over the
shoulders of that which was in front.&nbsp; There were several,
and those amongst the most experienced, who took the gloomiest
view of Harrison&rsquo;s chances, and it made my heart heavy to
overhear them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the old story over again,&rdquo; said
one.&nbsp; &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t bear in mind that youth will
be served.&nbsp; They only learn wisdom when it&rsquo;s knocked
into them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, ay,&rdquo; responded another.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how Jack Slack thrashed Boughton, and I
myself saw Hooper, the tinman, beat to pieces by the fighting
oilman.&nbsp; They all come to it in time, and now it&rsquo;s
Harrison&rsquo;s turn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you be so sure about that!&rdquo; cried a
third.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen Jack Harrison fight five
times, and I never yet saw him have the worse of it.&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s a slaughterer, and so I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was, you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t see no such difference as all that
comes to, and I&rsquo;m putting ten guineas on my
opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said a loud, consequential man from
immediately behind me, speaking with a broad western burr,
&ldquo;vrom what I&rsquo;ve zeen of this young Gloucester lad, I
doan&rsquo;t think Harrison could have stood bevore him for ten
rounds when he vas in his prime.&nbsp; I vas coming up in the
Bristol coach yesterday, and the guard he told me that he had
vifteen thousand pound in hard gold in the boot that had been
zent up to back our man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll be in luck if they see their money
again,&rdquo; said another.&nbsp; &ldquo;Harrison&rsquo;s no
lady&rsquo;s-maid fighter, and he&rsquo;s blood to the
bone.&nbsp; He&rsquo;d have a shy at it if his man was as big as
Carlton House.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut,&rdquo; answered the west-countryman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only in Bristol and Gloucester that you can get
men to beat Bristol and Gloucester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like your damned himpudence to say
so,&rdquo; said an angry voice from the throng behind him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There are six men in London that would hengage to walk
round the best twelve that hever came from the west.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The proceedings might have opened by an impromptu bye-battle
between the indignant cockney and the gentleman from Bristol, but
a prolonged roar of applause broke in upon their
altercation.&nbsp; It was caused by the appearance in the ring of
Crab Wilson, followed by Dutch Sam and Mendoza carrying the
basin, sponge, brandy-bladder, and other badges of their
office.&nbsp; As he entered Wilson pulled the canary-yellow
handkerchief from his waist, and going to the corner post, he
tied it to the top of it, where it remained fluttering in the
breeze.&nbsp; He then took a bundle of smaller ribands of the
same colour from his seconds, and walking round, he offered them
to the noblemen and Corinthians at half-a-guinea apiece as
souvenirs of the fight.&nbsp; His brisk trade was only brought to
an end by the appearance of Harrison, who climbed in a very
leisurely manner over the ropes, as befitted his more mature
years and less elastic joints.&nbsp; The yell which greeted him
was even more enthusiastic than that which had heralded Wilson,
and there was a louder ring of admiration in it, for the crowd
had already had their opportunity of seeing Wilson&rsquo;s
physique, whilst Harrison&rsquo;s was a surprise to them.</p>
<p>I had often looked upon the mighty arms and neck of the smith,
but I had never before seen him stripped to the waist, or
understood the marvellous symmetry of development which had made
him in his youth the favourite model of the London
sculptors.&nbsp; There was none of that white sleek skin and
shimmering play of sinew which made Wilson a beautiful picture,
but in its stead there was a rugged grandeur of knotted and
tangled muscle, as though the roots of some old tree were
writhing from breast to shoulder, and from shoulder to
elbow.&nbsp; Even in repose the sun threw shadows from the curves
of his skin, but when he exerted himself every muscle bunched
itself up, distinct and hard, breaking his whole trunk into
gnarled knots of sinew.&nbsp; His skin, on face and body, was
darker and harsher than that of his youthful antagonist, but he
looked tougher and harder, an effect which was increased by the
sombre colour of his stockings and breeches.&nbsp; He entered the
ring, sucking a lemon, with Jim Belcher and Caleb Baldwin, the
coster, at his heels.&nbsp; Strolling across to the post, he tied
his blue bird&rsquo;s-eye handkerchief over the
west-countryman&rsquo;s yellow, and then walked to his opponent
with his hand out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I see you well, Wilson,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pretty tidy, I thank you,&rdquo; answered the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll speak to each other in a
different vashion, I &rsquo;spects, afore we part.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no ill-feeling,&rdquo; said the smith, and the two
fighting men grinned at each other as they took their own
corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I ask, Mr. Referee, whether these two men have been
weighed?&rdquo; asked Sir Lothian Hume, standing up in the outer
ring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their weight has just been taken under my supervision,
sir,&rdquo; answered Mr. Craven.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your man brought
the scale down at thirteen-three, and Harrison at
thirteen-eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a fifteen-stoner from the loins
upwards,&rdquo; cried Dutch Sam, from his corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll get some of it off him before we
finish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get more off him than ever you bargained
for,&rdquo; answered Jim Belcher, and the crowd laughed at the
rough chaff.</p>

294</span>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE SMITH&rsquo;S LAST BATTLE.</span></h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Clear</span> the outer ring!&rdquo;
cried Jackson, standing up beside the ropes with a big silver
watch in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ss-whack! ss-whack! ss-whack!&rdquo; went the
horse-whips&mdash;for a number of the spectators, either driven
onwards by the pressure behind or willing to risk some physical
pain on the chance of getting a better view, had crept under the
ropes and formed a ragged fringe within the outer ring.&nbsp;
Now, amidst roars of laughter from the crowd and a shower of
blows from the beaters-out, they dived madly back, with the
ungainly haste of frightened sheep blundering through a gap in
their hurdles.&nbsp; Their case was a hard one, for the folk in
front refused to yield an inch of their places&mdash;but the
arguments from the rear prevailed over everything else, and
presently every frantic fugitive had been absorbed, whilst the
beaters-out took their stands along the edge at regular
intervals, with their whips held down by their thighs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; cried Jackson, again, &ldquo;I am
requested to inform you that Sir Charles Tregellis&rsquo;s
nominee is Jack Harrison, fighting at thirteen-eight, and Sir
Lothian Hume&rsquo;s is Crab Wilson, at thirteen-three.&nbsp; No
person can be allowed at the inner ropes save the referee and the
timekeeper.&nbsp; I have only to beg that, if the occasion should
require it, you will all give me your assistance to keep the
ground clear, to prevent confusion, and to have a fair
fight.&nbsp; All ready?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All ready!&rdquo; from both corners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a breathless hush as Harrison, Wilson, Belcher, and
Dutch Sam walked very briskly into the centre of the ring.&nbsp;
The two men shook hands, whilst their seconds did the same, the
four hands crossing each other.&nbsp; Then the seconds dropped
back, and the two champions stood toe to toe, with their hands
up.</p>
<p>It was a magnificent sight to any one who had not lost his
sense of appreciation of the noblest of all the works of
Nature.&nbsp; Both men fulfilled that requisite of the powerful
athlete that they should look larger without their clothes than
with them.&nbsp; In ring slang, they buffed well.&nbsp; And each
showed up the other&rsquo;s points on account of the extreme
contrast between them: the long, loose-limbed, deer-footed
youngster, and the square-set, rugged veteran with his trunk like
the stump of an oak.&nbsp; The betting began to rise upon the
younger man from the instant that they were put face to face, for
his advantages were obvious, whilst those qualities which had
brought Harrison to the top in his youth were only a memory in
the minds of the older men.&nbsp; All could see the three inches
extra of height and two of reach which Wilson possessed, and a
glance at the quick, cat-like motions of his feet, and the
perfect poise of his body upon his legs, showed how swiftly he
could spring either in or out from his slower adversary.&nbsp;
But it took a subtler insight to read the grim smile which
flickered over the smith&rsquo;s mouth, or the smouldering fire
which shone in his grey eyes, and it was only the old-timers who
knew that, with his mighty heart and his iron frame, he was a
perilous man to lay odds against.</p>
<p>Wilson stood in the position from which he had derived his
nickname, his left hand and left foot well to the front, his body
sloped very far back from his loins, and his guard thrown across
his chest, but held well forward in a way which made him
exceedingly hard to get at.&nbsp; The smith, on the other hand,
assumed the obsolete attitude which Humphries and Mendoza
introduced, but which had not for ten years been seen in a
first-class battle.&nbsp; Both his knees were slightly bent, he
stood square to his opponent, and his two big brown fists were
held over his mark so that he could lead equally with
either.&nbsp; Wilson&rsquo;s hands, which moved incessantly in
and out, had been stained with some astringent juice with the
purpose of preventing them from puffing, and so great was the
contrast between them and his white forearms, that I imagined
that he was wearing dark, close-fitting gloves until my uncle
explained the matter in a whisper.&nbsp; So they stood in a
quiver of eagerness and expectation, whilst that huge multitude
hung so silently and breathlessly upon every motion that they
might have believed themselves to be alone, man to man, in the
centre of some primeval solitude.</p>
<p>It was evident from the beginning that Crab Wilson meant to
throw no chance away, and that he would trust to his lightness of
foot and quickness of hand until he should see something of the
tactics of this rough-looking antagonist.&nbsp; He paced swiftly
round several times, with little, elastic, menacing steps, whilst
the smith pivoted slowly to correspond.&nbsp; Then, as Wilson
took a backward step to induce Harrison to break his ground and
follow him, the older man grinned and shook his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must come to me, lad,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too old to scamper round the ring after
you.&nbsp; But we have the day before us, and I&rsquo;ll
wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He may not have expected his invitation to be so promptly
answered; but in an instant, with a panther spring, the
west-countryman was on him.&nbsp; Smack! smack! smack!&nbsp;
Thud! thud!&nbsp; The first three were on Harrison&rsquo;s face,
the last two were heavy counters upon Wilson&rsquo;s body.&nbsp;
Back danced the youngster, disengaging himself in beautiful
style, but with two angry red blotches over the lower line of his
ribs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Blood for Wilson!&rdquo; yelled the crowd, and
as the smith faced round to follow the movements of his nimble
adversary, I saw with a thrill that his chin was crimson and
dripping.&nbsp; In came Wilson again with a feint at the mark and
a flush hit on Harrison&rsquo;s cheek; then, breaking the force
of the smith&rsquo;s ponderous right counter, he brought the
round to a conclusion by slipping down upon the grass.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First knock-down for Harrison!&rdquo; roared a thousand
voices, for ten times as many pounds would change hands upon the
point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I appeal to the referee!&rdquo; cried Sir Lothian
Hume.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was a slip, and not a
knock-down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give it a slip,&rdquo; said Berkeley Craven, and the
men walked to their corners, amidst a general shout of applause
for a spirited and well-contested opening round.&nbsp; Harrison
fumbled in his mouth with his finger and thumb, and then with a
sharp half-turn he wrenched out a tooth, which he threw into the
basin.&nbsp; &ldquo;Quite like old times,&rdquo; said he to
Belcher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a care, Jack!&rdquo; whispered the anxious
second.&nbsp; &ldquo;You got rather more than you
gave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can carry more, too,&rdquo; said he serenely,
whilst Caleb Baldwin mopped the big sponge over his face, and the
shining bottom of the tin basin ceased suddenly to glimmer
through the water.</p>
<p>I could gather from the comments of the experienced
Corinthians around me, and from the remarks of the crowd behind,
that Harrison&rsquo;s chance was thought to have been lessened by
this round.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen his old faults and I haven&rsquo;t seen
his old merits,&rdquo; said Sir John Lade, our opponent of the
Brighton Road.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s as slow on his feet and
with his guard as ever.&nbsp; Wilson hit him as he
liked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wilson may hit him three times to his once, but his one
is worth Wilson&rsquo;s three,&rdquo; remarked my uncle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a natural fighter and the other an excellent
sparrer, but I don&rsquo;t hedge a guinea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sudden hush announced that the men were on their feet again,
and so skilfully had the seconds done their work, that neither
looked a jot the worse for what had passed.&nbsp; Wilson led
viciously with his left, but misjudged his distance, receiving a
smashing counter on the mark in reply which sent him reeling and
gasping to the ropes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hurrah for the old one!&rdquo;
yelled the mob, and my uncle laughed and nudged Sir John
Lade.&nbsp; The west-countryman smiled, and shook himself like a
dog from the water as with a stealthy step he came back to the
centre of the ring, where his man was still standing.&nbsp; Bang
came Harrison&rsquo;s right upon the mark once more, but Crab
broke the blow with his elbow, and jumped laughing away.&nbsp;
Both men were a little winded, and their quick, high breathing,
with the light patter of their feet as they danced round each
other, blended into one continuous, long-drawn sound.&nbsp; Two
simultaneous exchanges with the left made a clap like a
pistol-shot, and then as Harrison rushed in for a fall, Wilson
slipped him, and over went my old friend upon his face, partly
from the impetus of his own futile attack, and partly from a
swinging half-arm blow which the west-countryman brought home
upon his ear as he passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knock-down for Wilson,&rdquo; cried the referee, and
the answering roar was like the broadside of a
seventy-four.&nbsp; Up went hundreds of curly brimmed Corinthian
hats into the air, and the slope before us was a bank of flushed
and yelling faces.&nbsp; My heart was cramped with my fears, and
I winced at every blow, yet I was conscious also of an absolute
fascination, with a wild thrill of fierce joy and a certain
exultation in our common human nature which could rise above pain
and fear in its straining after the very humblest form of
fame.</p>
<p>Belcher and Baldwin had pounced upon their man, and had him up
and in his corner in an instant, but, in spite of the coolness
with which the hardy smith took his punishment, there was immense
exultation amongst the west-countrymen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got him!&nbsp; He&rsquo;s beat!&nbsp;
He&rsquo;s beat!&rdquo; shouted the two Jew seconds.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hundred to a tizzy on Gloucester!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beat, is he?&rdquo; answered Belcher.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll need to rent this field before you can beat
him, for he&rsquo;ll stand a month of that kind of
fly-flappin&rsquo;.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was swinging a towel in front
of Harrison as he spoke, whilst Baldwin mopped him with the
sponge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is it with you, Harrison?&rdquo; asked my
uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hearty as a buck, sir.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s as right as the
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cheery answer came with so merry a ring that the clouds
cleared from my uncle&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should recommend your man to lead more,
Tregellis,&rdquo; said Sir John Lade.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll
never win it unless he leads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows more about the game than you or I do,
Lade.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll let him take his own way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The betting is three to one against him now,&rdquo;
said a gentleman, whose grizzled moustache showed that he was an
officer of the late war.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true, General Fitzpatrick.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;ll
observe that it is the raw young bloods who are giving the odds,
and the Sheenies who are taking them.&nbsp; I still stick to my
opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men came briskly up to the scratch at the call of
time, the smith a little lumpy on one side of his head, but with
the same good-humoured and yet menacing smile upon his
lips.&nbsp; As to Wilson, he was exactly as he had begun in
appearance, but twice I saw him close his lips sharply as if he
were in a sudden spasm of pain, and the blotches over his ribs
were darkening from scarlet to a sullen purple.&nbsp; He held his
guard somewhat lower to screen this vulnerable point, and he
danced round his opponent with a lightness which showed that his
wind had not been impaired by the body-blows, whilst the smith
still adopted the impassive tactics with which he had
commenced.</p>
<p>Many rumours had come up to us from the west as to Crab
Wilson&rsquo;s fine science and the quickness of his hitting, but
the truth surpassed what had been expected of him.&nbsp; In this
round and the two which followed he showed a swiftness and
accuracy which old ringsiders declared that Mendoza in his prime
had never surpassed.&nbsp; He was in and out like lightning, and
his blows were heard and felt rather than seen.&nbsp; But
Harrison still took them all with the same dogged smile,
occasionally getting in a hard body-blow in return, for his
adversary&rsquo;s height and his position combined to keep his
face out of danger.&nbsp; At the end of the fifth round the odds
were four to one, and the west-countrymen were riotous in their
exultation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What think you now?&rdquo; cried the west-countryman
behind me, and in his excitement he could get no further save to
repeat over and over again, &ldquo;What think you
now?&rdquo;&nbsp; When in the sixth round the smith was peppered
twice without getting in a counter, and had the worst of the fall
as well, the fellow became inarticulate altogether, and could
only huzza wildly in his delight.&nbsp; Sir Lothian Hume was
smiling and nodding his head, whilst my uncle was coldly
impassive, though I was sure that his heart was as heavy as
mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do, Tregellis,&rdquo; said General
Fitzpatrick.&nbsp; &ldquo;My money is on the old one, but the
other is the finer boxer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My man is <i>un peu pass&eacute;</i>, but he will come
through all right,&rdquo; answered my uncle.</p>
<p>I saw that both Belcher and Baldwin were looking grave, and I
knew that we must have a change of some sort, or the old tale of
youth and age would be told once more.</p>
<p>The seventh round, however, showed the reserve strength of the
hardy old fighter, and lengthened the faces of those layers of
odds who had imagined that the fight was practically over, and
that a few finishing rounds would have given the smith his
<i>coup-de-gr&acirc;ce</i>.&nbsp; It was clear when the two men
faced each other that Wilson had made himself up for mischief,
and meant to force the fighting and maintain the lead which he
had gained, but that grey gleam was not quenched yet in the
veteran&rsquo;s eyes, and still the same smile played over his
grim face.&nbsp; He had become more jaunty, too, in the swing of
his shoulders and the poise of his head, and it brought my
confidence back to see the brisk way in which he squared up to
his man.</p>
<p>Wilson led with his left, but was short, and he only just
avoided a dangerous right-hander which whistled in at his
ribs.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bravo, old &rsquo;un, one of those will be a
dose of laudanum if you get it home,&rdquo; cried Belcher.&nbsp;
There was a pause of shuffling feet and hard breathing, broken by
the thud of a tremendous body blow from Wilson, which the smith
stopped with the utmost coolness.&nbsp; Then again a few seconds
of silent tension, when Wilson led viciously at the head, but
Harrison took it on his forearm, smiling and nodding at his
opponent.&nbsp; &ldquo;Get the pepper-box open!&rdquo; yelled
Mendoza, and Wilson sprang in to carry out his instructions, but
was hit out again by a heavy drive on the chest.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now&rsquo;s the time!&nbsp; Follow it up!&rdquo; cried
Belcher, and in rushed the smith, pelting in his half-arm blows,
and taking the returns without a wince, until Crab Wilson went
down exhausted in the corner.&nbsp; Both men had their marks to
show, but Harrison had all the best of the rally, so it was our
turn to throw our hats into the air and to shout ourselves
hoarse, whilst the seconds clapped their man upon his broad back
as they hurried him to his corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What think you now?&rdquo; shouted all the neighbours
of the west-countryman, repeating his own refrain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Dutch Sam never put in a better rally,&rdquo;
cried Sir John Lade.&nbsp; &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the betting now,
Sir Lothian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have laid all that I intend; but I don&rsquo;t think
my man can lose it.&rdquo;&nbsp; For all that, the smile had
faded from his face, and I observed that he glanced continually
over his shoulder into the crowd behind him.</p>
<p>A sullen purple cloud had been drifting slowly up from the
south-west&mdash;though I dare say that out of thirty thousand
folk there were very few who had spared the time or attention to
mark it.&nbsp; Now it suddenly made its presence apparent by a
few heavy drops of rain, thickening rapidly into a sharp shower,
which filled the air with its hiss, and rattled noisily upon the
high, hard hats of the Corinthians.&nbsp; Coat-collars were
turned up and handkerchiefs tied round necks, whilst the skins of
the two men glistened with the moisture as they stood up to each
other once more.&nbsp; I noticed that Belcher whispered very
earnestly into Harrison&rsquo;s ear as he rose from his knee, and
that the smith nodded his head curtly, with the air of a man who
understands and approves of his orders.</p>
<p>And what those orders were was instantly apparent.&nbsp;
Harrison was to be turned from the defender into the
attacker.&nbsp; The result of the rally in the last round had
convinced his seconds that when it came to give-and-take hitting,
their hardy and powerful man was likely to have the better of
it.&nbsp; And then on the top of this came the rain.&nbsp; With
the slippery grass the superior activity of Wilson would be
neutralized, and he would find it harder to avoid the rushes of
his opponent.&nbsp; It was in taking advantage of such
circumstances that the art of ringcraft lay, and many a shrewd
and vigilant second had won a losing battle for his man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go in, then!&nbsp; Go in!&rdquo; whooped the two
prize-fighters, while every backer in the crowd took up the
roar.</p>
<p>And Harrison went in, in such fashion that no man who saw him
do it will ever forget it.&nbsp; Crab Wilson, as game as a
pebble, met him with a flush hit every time, but no human
strength or human science seemed capable of stopping the terrible
onslaught of this iron man.&nbsp; Round after round he scrambled
his way in, slap-bang, right and left, every hit tremendously
sent home.&nbsp; Sometimes he covered his own face with his left,
and sometimes he disdained to use any guard at all, but his
springing hits were irresistible.&nbsp; The rain lashed down upon
them, pouring from their faces and running in crimson trickles
over their bodies, but neither gave any heed to it save to
man&oelig;uvre always with the view of bringing it in to each
other&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; But round after round the
west-countryman fell, and round after round the betting rose,
until the odds were higher in our favour than ever they had been
against us.&nbsp; With a sinking heart, filled with pity and
admiration for these two gallant men, I longed that every bout
might be the last, and yet the &ldquo;Time!&rdquo; was hardly out
of Jackson&rsquo;s mouth before they had both sprung from their
second&rsquo;s knees, with laughter upon their mutilated faces
and chaffing words upon their bleeding lips.&nbsp; It may have
been a humble object-lesson, but I give you my word that many a
time in my life I have braced myself to a hard task by the
remembrance of that morning upon Crawley Downs, asking myself if
my manhood were so weak that I would not do for my country, or
for those whom I loved, as much as these two would endure for a
paltry stake and for their own credit amongst their
fellows.&nbsp; Such a spectacle may brutalize those who are
brutal, but I say that there is a spiritual side to it also, and
that the sight of the utmost human limit of endurance and courage
is one which bears a lesson of its own.</p>
<p>But if the ring can breed bright virtues, it is but a partisan
who can deny that it can be the mother of black vices also, and
we were destined that morning to have a sight of each.&nbsp; It
so chanced that, as the battle went against his man, my eyes
stole round very often to note the expression upon Sir Lothian
Hume&rsquo;s face, for I knew how fearlessly he had laid the
odds, and I understood that his fortunes as well as his champion
were going down before the smashing blows of the old
bruiser.&nbsp; The confident smile with which he had watched the
opening rounds had long vanished from his lips, and his cheeks
had turned of a sallow pallor, whilst his small, fierce grey eyes
looked furtively from under his craggy brows, and more than once
he burst into savage imprecations when Wilson was beaten to the
ground.&nbsp; But especially I noticed that his chin was always
coming round to his shoulder, and that at the end of every round
he sent keen little glances flying backwards into the
crowd.&nbsp; For some time, amidst the immense hillside of faces
which banked themselves up on the slope behind us, I was unable
to pick out the exact point at which his gaze was directed.&nbsp;
But at last I succeeded in following it.&nbsp; A very tall man,
who showed a pair of broad, bottle-green shoulders high above his
neighbours, was looking very hard in our direction, and I assured
myself that a quick exchange of almost imperceptible signals was
going on between him and the Corinthian baronet.&nbsp; I became
conscious, also, as I watched this stranger, that the cluster of
men around him were the roughest elements of the whole assembly:
fierce, vicious-looking fellows, with cruel, debauched faces, who
howled like a pack of wolves at every blow, and yelled
execrations at Harrison whenever he walked across to his
corner.&nbsp; So turbulent were they that I saw the ringkeepers
whisper together and glance up in their direction, as if
preparing for trouble in store, but none of them had realized how
near it was to breaking out, or how dangerous it might prove.</p>
<p>Thirty rounds had been fought in an hour and twenty-five
minutes, and the rain was pelting down harder than ever.&nbsp; A
thick steam rose from the two fighters, and the ring was a pool
of mud.&nbsp; Repeated falls had turned the men brown, with a
horrible mottling of crimson blotches.&nbsp; Round after round
had ended by Crab Wilson going down, and it was evident, even to
my inexperienced eyes, that he was weakening rapidly.&nbsp; He
leaned heavily upon the two Jews when they led him to his corner,
and he reeled when their support was withdrawn.&nbsp; Yet his
science had, through long practice, become an automatic thing
with him, so that he stopped and hit with less power, but with as
great accuracy as ever.&nbsp; Even now a casual observer might
have thought that he had the best of the battle, for the smith
was far the more terribly marked, but there was a wild stare in
the west-countryman&rsquo;s eyes, and a strange catch in his
breathing, which told us that it is not the most dangerous blow
which shows upon the surface.&nbsp; A heavy cross-buttock at the
end of the thirty-first round shook the breath from his body, and
he came up for the thirty-second with the same jaunty gallantry
as ever, but with the dazed expression of a man whose wind has
been utterly smashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got the roly-polies,&rdquo; cried
Belcher.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have it your own way now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll vight for a week yet,&rdquo; gasped
Wilson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damme, I like his style,&rdquo; cried Sir John
Lade.&nbsp; &ldquo;No shifting, nothing shy, no hugging nor
hauling.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a shame to let him fight.&nbsp; Take
the brave fellow away!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take him away!&nbsp; Take him away!&rdquo; echoed a
hundred voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t be taken away!&nbsp; Who dares say
so?&rdquo; cried Wilson, who was back, after another fall, upon
his second&rsquo;s knee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His heart won&rsquo;t suffer him to cry enough,&rdquo;
said General Fitzpatrick.&nbsp; &ldquo;As his patron, Sir
Lothian, you should direct the sponge to be thrown up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he can&rsquo;t win it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is hopelessly beat, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know him.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a glutton of
the first water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gamer man never pulled his shirt off; but the other
is too strong for him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sir, I believe that he can fight another ten
rounds.&rdquo;&nbsp; He half turned as he spoke, and I saw him
throw up his left arm with a singular gesture into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cut the ropes!&nbsp; Fair play!&nbsp; Wait till the
rain stops!&rdquo; roared a stentorian voice behind me, and I saw
that it came from the big man with the bottle-green coat.&nbsp;
His cry was a signal, for, like a thunderclap, there came a
hundred hoarse voices shouting together: &ldquo;Fair play for
Gloucester!&nbsp; Break the ring!&nbsp; Break the
ring!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson had called &ldquo;Time,&rdquo; and the two
mud-plastered men were already upon their feet, but the interest
had suddenly changed from the fight to the audience.&nbsp; A
succession of heaves from the back of the crowd had sent a series
of long ripples running through it, all the heads swaying
rhythmically in the one direction like a wheatfield in a
squall.&nbsp; With every impulsion the oscillation increased,
those in front trying vainly to steady themselves against the
rushes from behind, until suddenly there came a sharp snap, two
white stakes with earth clinging to their points flew into the
outer ring, and a spray of people, dashed from the solid wave
behind, were thrown against the line of the beaters-out.&nbsp;
Down came the long horse-whips, swayed by the most vigorous arms
in England; but the wincing and shouting victims had no sooner
scrambled back a few yards from the merciless cuts, before a
fresh charge from the rear hurled them once more into the arms of
the prize-fighters.&nbsp; Many threw themselves down upon the
turf and allowed successive waves to pass over their bodies,
whilst others, driven wild by the blows, returned them with their
hunting-crops and walking-canes.&nbsp; And then, as half the
crowd strained to the left and half to the right to avoid the
pressure from behind, the vast mass was suddenly reft in twain,
and through the gap surged the rough fellows from behind, all
armed with loaded sticks and yelling for &ldquo;Fair play and
Gloucester!&rdquo;&nbsp; Their determined rush carried the
prize-fighters before them, the inner ropes snapped like threads,
and in an instant the ring was a swirling,&rsquo; seething mass
of figures, whips and sticks falling and clattering, whilst, face
to face, in the middle of it all, so wedged that they could
neither advance nor retreat, the smith and the west-countryman
continued their long-drawn battle as oblivious of the chaos
raging round them as two bulldogs would have been who had got
each other by the throat.&nbsp; The driving rain, the cursing and
screams of pain, the swish of the blows, the yelling of orders
and advice, the heavy smell of the damp cloth&mdash;every
incident of that scene of my early youth comes back to me now in
my old age as clearly as if it had been but yesterday.</p>
<p>It was not easy for us to observe anything at the time,
however, for we were ourselves in the midst of the frantic crowd,
swaying about and carried occasionally quite off our feet, but
endeavouring to keep our places behind Jackson and Berkeley
Craven, who, with sticks and whips meeting over their heads, were
still calling the rounds and superintending the fight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ring&rsquo;s broken!&rdquo; shouted Sir Lothian
Hume.&nbsp; &ldquo;I appeal to the referee!&nbsp; The fight is
null and void.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You villain!&rdquo; cried my uncle, hotly; &ldquo;this
is your doing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have already an account to answer for with
me,&rdquo; said Hume, with his sinister sneer, and as he spoke he
was swept by the rush of the crowd into my uncle&rsquo;s very
arms.&nbsp; The two men&rsquo;s faces were not more than a few
inches apart, and Sir Lothian&rsquo;s bold eyes had to sink
before the imperious scorn which gleamed coldly in those of my
uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will settle our accounts, never fear, though I
degrade myself in meeting such a blackleg.&nbsp; What is it,
Craven?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have to declare a draw, Tregellis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My man has the fight in hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot help it.&nbsp; I cannot attend to my duties
when every moment I am cut over with a whip or a
stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jackson suddenly made a wild dash into the crowd, but returned
with empty hands and a rueful face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve stolen my timekeeper&rsquo;s
watch,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;A little cove snatched it
out of my hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle clapped his hand to his fob.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine has gone also!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Draw it at once, or your man will get hurt,&rdquo; said
Jackson, and we saw that as the undaunted smith stood up to
Wilson for another round, a dozen rough fellows were clustering
round him with bludgeons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you consent to a draw, Sir Lothian Hume?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you, Sir Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The ring is gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is no fault of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I see no help for it.&nbsp; As referee I order
that the men be withdrawn, and that the stakes be returned to
their owners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A draw!&nbsp; A draw!&rdquo; shrieked every one, and
the crowd in an instant dispersed in every direction, the
pedestrians running to get a good lead upon the London road, and
the Corinthians in search of their horses and carriages.&nbsp;
Harrison ran over to Wilson&rsquo;s corner and shook him by the
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I have not hurt you much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m hard put to it to stand.&nbsp; How are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head&rsquo;s singin&rsquo; like a kettle.&nbsp; It
was the rain that helped me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I thought I had you beat one time.&nbsp; I never
wish a better battle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor me either.&nbsp; Good-bye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so those two brave-hearted fellows made their way amidst
the yelping roughs, like two wounded lions amidst a pack of
wolves and jackals.&nbsp; I say again that, if the ring has
fallen low, it is not in the main the fault of the men who have
done the fighting, but it lies at the door of the vile crew of
ring-side parasites and ruffians, who are as far below the honest
pugilist as the welsher and the blackleg are below the noble
racehorse which serves them as a pretext for their
villainies.</p>

314</span>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">CLIFFE ROYAL.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> uncle was humanely anxious to
get Harrison to bed as soon as possible, for the smith, although
he laughed at his own injuries, had none the less been severely
punished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare ever to ask my leave to fight
again, Jack Harrison,&rdquo; said his wife, as she looked
ruefully at his battered face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s worse
than when you beat Black Baruk; and if it weren&rsquo;t for your
topcoat, I couldn&rsquo;t swear you were the man who led me to
the altar!&nbsp; If the King of England ask you, I&rsquo;ll never
let you do it more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, old lass, I give my davy that I never will.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s best that I leave fightin&rsquo; before fightin&rsquo;
leaves me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He screwed up his face as he took a sup
from Sir Charles&rsquo;s brandy flask.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
fine liquor, sir, but it gets into my cut lips most cruel.&nbsp;
Why, here&rsquo;s John Cummings of the Friars&rsquo; Oak Inn, as
I&rsquo;m a sinner, and seekin&rsquo; for a mad doctor, to judge
by the look of him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was certainly a most singular figure who was approaching us
over the moor.&nbsp; With the flushed, dazed face of a man who is
just recovering from recent intoxication, the landlord was
tearing madly about, his hat gone, and his hair and beard flying
in the wind.&nbsp; He ran in little zigzags from one knot of
people to another, whilst his peculiar appearance drew a running
fire of witticisms as he went, so that he reminded me
irresistibly of a snipe skimming along through a line of
guns.&nbsp; We saw him stop for an instant by the yellow
barouche, and hand something to Sir Lothian Hume.&nbsp; Then on
he came again, until at last, catching sight of us, he gave a cry
of joy, and ran for us full speed with a note held out at
arm&rsquo;s length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a nice cove, too, John Cummings,&rdquo;
said Harrison, reproachfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell
you not to let a drop pass your lips until you had given your
message to Sir Charles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to be pole-axed, I ought,&rdquo; he cried in
bitter repentance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I asked for you, Sir Charles, as
I&rsquo;m a livin&rsquo; man, I did, but you weren&rsquo;t there,
and what with bein&rsquo; so pleased at gettin&rsquo; such odds
when I knew Harrison was goin&rsquo; to fight, an&rsquo; what
with the landlord at the George wantin&rsquo; me to try his own
specials, I let my senses go clean away from me.&nbsp; And now
it&rsquo;s only after the fight is over that I see you, Sir
Charles, an&rsquo; if you lay that whip over my back, it&rsquo;s
only what I deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But my uncle was paying no attention whatever to the voluble
self-reproaches of the landlord.&nbsp; He had opened the note,
and was reading it with a slight raising of the eyebrows, which
was almost the very highest note in his limited emotional
gamut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What make you of this, nephew?&rdquo; he asked, handing
it to me.</p>
<p>This was what I read&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir Charles
Tregellis</span>,</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, come at once, when this reaches
you, to Cliffe Royal, and tarry as little as possible upon the
way.&nbsp; You will see me there, and you will hear much which
concerns you deeply.&nbsp; I pray you to come as soon as may be;
and until then I remain him whom you knew as</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span class="smcap">James
Harrison</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Well, nephew?&rdquo; asked my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, I cannot tell what it may mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who gave it to you, sirrah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was young Jim Harrison himself, sir,&rdquo; said the
landlord, &ldquo;though indeed I scarce knew him at first, for he
looked like his own ghost.&nbsp; He was so eager that it should
reach you that he would not leave me until the horse was
harnessed and I started upon my way.&nbsp; There was one note for
you and one for Sir Lothian Hume, and I wish to God he had chosen
a better messenger!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a mystery indeed,&rdquo; said my uncle, bending
his brows over the note.&nbsp; &ldquo;What should he be doing at
that house of ill-omen?&nbsp; And why does he sign himself
&lsquo;him whom you knew as Jim Harrison?&rsquo;&nbsp; By what
other style should I know him?&nbsp; Harrison, you can throw a
light upon this.&nbsp; You, Mrs. Harrison; I see by your face
that you understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe we do, Sir Charles; but we are plain folk, my
Jack and I, and we go as far as we see our way, and when we
don&rsquo;t see our way any longer, we just stop.&nbsp;
We&rsquo;ve been goin&rsquo; this twenty year, but now
we&rsquo;ll draw aside and let our betters get to the front; so
if you wish to find what that note means, I can only advise you
to do what you are asked, and to drive over to Cliffe Royal,
where you will find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle put the note into his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t move until I have seen you safely in the
hands of the surgeon, Harrison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind for me, sir.&nbsp; The missus and me can
drive down to Crawley in the gig, and a yard of stickin&rsquo;
plaster and a raw steak will soon set me to rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But my uncle was by no means to be persuaded, and he drove the
pair into Crawley, where the smith was left under the charge of
his wife in the very best quarters which money could
procure.&nbsp; Then, after a hasty luncheon, we turned the
mares&rsquo; heads for the south.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This ends my connection with the ring, nephew,&rdquo;
said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I perceive that there is no possible
means by which it can be kept pure from roguery.&nbsp; I have
been cheated and befooled; but a man learns wisdom at last, and
never again do I give countenance to a prize-fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had I been older or he less formidable, I might have said what
was in my heart, and begged him to give up other things
also&mdash;to come out from those shallow circles in which he
lived, and to find some work that was worthy of his strong brain
and his good heart.&nbsp; But the thought had hardly formed
itself in my mind before he had dropped his serious vein, and was
chatting away about some new silver-mounted harness which he
intended to spring upon the Mall, and about the match for a
thousand guineas which he meant to make between his filly
Ethelberta and Lord Doncaster&rsquo;s famous three-year-old
Aurelius.</p>
<p>We had got as far as Whiteman&rsquo;s Green, which is rather
more than midway between Crawley Down and Friars&rsquo; Oak,
when, looking backwards, I saw far down the road the gleam of the
sun upon a high yellow carriage.&nbsp; Sir Lothian Hume was
following us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has had the same summons as we, and is bound for the
same destination,&rdquo; said my uncle, glancing over his
shoulder at the distant barouche.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are both wanted
at Cliffe Royal&mdash;we, the two survivors of that black
business.&nbsp; And it is Jim Harrison of all people who calls us
there.&nbsp; Nephew, I have had an eventful life, but I feel as
if the very strangest scene of it were waiting for me among those
trees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whipped up the mares, and now from the curve of the road we
could see the high dark pinnacles of the old Manor-house shooting
up above the ancient oaks which ring it round.&nbsp; The sight of
it, with its bloodstained and ghost-blasted reputation, would in
itself have been enough to send a thrill through my nerves; but
when the words of my uncle made me suddenly realize that this
strange summons was indeed for the two men who were concerned in
that old-world tragedy, and that it was the playmate of my youth
who had sent it, I caught my breath as I seemed vaguely to catch
a glimpse of some portentous thing forming itself in front of
us.&nbsp; The rusted gates between the crumbling heraldic pillars
were folded back, and my uncle flicked the mares impatiently as
we flew up the weed-grown avenue, until he pulled them on their
haunches before the time-blotched steps.&nbsp; The front door was
open, and Boy Jim was waiting there to meet us.</p>
<p>But it was a different Boy Jim from him whom I had known and
loved.&nbsp; There was a change in him somewhere, a change so
marked that it was the first thing that I noticed, and yet so
subtle that I could not put words to it.&nbsp; He was not better
dressed than of old, for I well knew the old brown suit that he
wore.</p>
<p>He was not less comely, for his training had left him the very
model of what a man should be.&nbsp; And yet there was a change,
a touch of dignity in the expression, a suggestion of confidence
in the bearing which seemed, now that it was supplied, to be the
one thing which had been needed to give him harmony and
finish.</p>
<p>Somehow, in spite of his prowess, his old school name of
&ldquo;Boy&rdquo; had clung very naturally to him, until that
instant when I saw him standing in his self-contained and
magnificent manhood in the doorway of the ancient house.&nbsp; A
woman stood beside him, her hand resting upon his shoulder, and I
saw that it was Miss Hinton of Anstey Cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember me, Sir Charles Tregellis,&rdquo; said
she, coming forward, as we sprang down from the curricle.</p>
<p>My uncle looked hard at her with a puzzled face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think that I have the privilege, madame.&nbsp;
And yet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Polly Hinton, of the Haymarket.&nbsp; You surely cannot
have forgotten Polly Hinton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forgotten!&nbsp; Why, we have mourned for you in
Fops&rsquo; Alley for more years than I care to think of.&nbsp;
But what in the name of wonder&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was privately married, and I retired from the
stage.&nbsp; I want you to forgive me for taking Jim away from
you last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was you, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a stronger claim even than you could have.&nbsp;
You were his patron; I was his mother.&rdquo;&nbsp; She drew his
head down to hers as she spoke, and there, with their cheeks
together, were the two faces, the one stamped with the waning
beauty of womanhood, the other with the waxing strength of man,
and yet so alike in the dark eyes, the blue-black hair and the
broad white brow, that I marvelled that I had never read her
secret on the first days that I had seen them together.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;he is my own boy, and he
saved me from what is worse than death, as your nephew Rodney
could tell you.&nbsp; Yet my lips were sealed, and it was only
last night that I could tell him that it was his mother whom he
had brought back by his gentleness and his patience into the
sweetness of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, mother!&rdquo; said Jim, turning his lips to her
cheek.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are some things which are between
ourselves.&nbsp; But tell me, Sir Charles, how went the
fight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your uncle would have won it, but the roughs broke the
ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is no uncle of mine, Sir Charles, but he has been
the best and truest friend, both to me and to my father, that
ever the world could offer.&nbsp; I only know one as true,&rdquo;
he continued, taking me by the hand, &ldquo;and dear old Rodney
Stone is his name.&nbsp; But I trust he was not much
hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A week or two will set him right.&nbsp; But I cannot
pretend to understand how this matter stands, and you must allow
me to say that I have not heard you advance anything yet which
seems to me to justify you in abandoning your engagements at a
moment&rsquo;s notice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Sir Charles, and I am convinced that you will
acknowledge that I could not have done otherwise.&nbsp; But here,
if I mistake not, is Sir Lothian Hume.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The yellow barouche had swung into the avenue, and a few
moments later the weary, panting horses had pulled up behind our
curricle.&nbsp; Sir Lothian sprang out, looking as black as a
thunder-cloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay where you are, Corcoran,&rdquo; said he; and I
caught a glimpse of a bottle-green coat which told me who was his
travelling companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he continued,
looking round him with an insolent stare, &ldquo;I should vastly
like to know who has had the insolence to give me so pressing an
invitation to visit my own house, and what in the devil you mean
by daring to trespass upon my grounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise you that you will understand this and a good
deal more before we part, Sir Lothian,&rdquo; said Jim, with a
curious smile playing over his face.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you will
follow me, I will endeavour to make it all clear to
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With his mother&rsquo;s hand in his own, he led us into that
ill-omened room where the cards were still heaped upon the
sideboard, and the dark shadow lurked in the corner of the
ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, sirrah, your explanation!&rdquo; cried Sir
Lothian, standing with his arms folded by the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first explanations I owe to you, Sir Charles,&rdquo;
said Jim; and as I listened to his voice and noted his manner, I
could not but admire the effect which the company of her whom he
now knew to be his mother had had upon a rude country lad.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish to tell you what occurred last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell it for you, Jim,&rdquo; said his
mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must know, Sir Charles, that though my
son knew nothing of his parents, we were both alive, and had
never lost sight of him.&nbsp; For my part, I let him have his
own way in going to London and in taking up this challenge.&nbsp;
It was only yesterday that it came to the ears of his father, who
would have none of it.&nbsp; He was in the weakest health, and
his wishes were not to be gainsayed.&nbsp; He ordered me to go at
once and to bring his son to his side.&nbsp; I was at my
wit&rsquo;s end, for I was sure that Jim would never come unless
a substitute were provided for him.&nbsp; I went to the kind,
good couple who had brought him up, and I told them how matters
stood.&nbsp; Mrs. Harrison loved Jim as if he had been her own
son, and her husband loved mine, so they came to my help, and may
God bless them for their kindness to a distracted wife and
mother!&nbsp; Harrison would take Jim&rsquo;s place if Jim would
go to his father.&nbsp; Then I drove to Crawley.&nbsp; I found
out which was Jim&rsquo;s room, and I spoke to him through the
window, for I was sure that those who had backed him would not
let him go.&nbsp; I told him that I was his mother.&nbsp; I told
him who was his father.&nbsp; I said that I had my phaeton ready,
and that he might, for all I knew, be only in time to receive the
dying blessing of that parent whom he had never known.&nbsp;
Still the boy would not go until he had my assurance that
Harrison would take his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did he not leave a message with Belcher?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head was in a whirl, Sir Charles.&nbsp; To find a
father and a mother, a new name and a new rank in a few minutes
might turn a stronger brain than ever mine was.&nbsp; My mother
begged me to come with her, and I went.&nbsp; The phaeton was
waiting, but we had scarcely started when some fellow seized the
horses&rsquo; heads, and a couple of ruffians attacked us.&nbsp;
One of them I beat over the head with the butt of the whip, so
that he dropped the cudgel with which he was about to strike me;
then lashing the horse, I shook off the others and got safely
away.&nbsp; I cannot imagine who they were or why they should
molest us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Sir Lothian Hume could tell you,&rdquo; said my
uncle.</p>
<p>Our enemy said nothing; but his little grey eyes slid round
with a most murderous glance in our direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I had come here and seen my father I went
down&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle stopped him with a cry of astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say, young man?&nbsp; You came here and
you saw your father&mdash;here at Cliffe Royal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle had turned very pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In God&rsquo;s name, then, tell us who your father
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim made no answer save to point over our shoulders, and
glancing round, we became aware that two people had entered the
room through the door which led to the bedroom stair.&nbsp; The
one I recognized in an instant.&nbsp; That impassive, mask-like
face and demure manner could only belong to Ambrose, the former
valet of my uncle.&nbsp; The other was a very different and even
more singular figure.&nbsp; He was a tall man, clad in a dark
dressing-gown, and leaning heavily upon a stick.&nbsp; His long,
bloodless countenance was so thin and so white that it gave the
strangest illusion of transparency.&nbsp; Only within the folds
of a shroud have I ever seen so wan a face.&nbsp; The brindled
hair and the rounded back gave the impression of advanced age,
and it was only the dark brows and the bright alert eyes glancing
out from beneath them which made me doubt whether it was really
an old man who stood before us.</p>
<p>There was an instant of silence, broken by a deep oath from
Sir Lothian Hume&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Avon, by God!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much at your service, gentlemen,&rdquo; answered
the strange figure in the dressing-gown.</p>

326</span>CHAPTER XX.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">LORD AVON.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> uncle was an impassive man by
nature and had become more so by the tradition of the society in
which he lived.&nbsp; He could have turned a card upon which his
fortune depended without the twitch of a muscle, and I had seen
him myself driving to imminent death on the Godstone Road with as
calm a face as if he were out for his daily airing in the
Mall.&nbsp; But now the shock which had come upon him was so
great that he could only stand with white cheeks and staring,
incredulous eyes.&nbsp; Twice I saw him open his lips, and twice
he put his hand up to his throat, as though a barrier had risen
betwixt himself and his utterance.&nbsp; Finally, he took a
sudden little run forward with both his hands thrown out in
greeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ned!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>But the strange man who stood before him folded his arms over
his breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Charles,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>My uncle stopped and looked at him in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely, Ned, you have a greeting for me after all these
years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believed me to have done this deed, Charles.&nbsp;
I read it in your eyes and in your manner on that terrible
morning.&nbsp; You never asked me for an explanation.&nbsp; You
never considered how impossible such a crime must be for a man of
my character.&nbsp; At the first breath of suspicion you, my
intimate friend, the man who knew me best, set me down as a thief
and a murderer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did, Charles; I read it in your eyes.&nbsp; And so
it was that when I wished to leave that which was most precious
to me in safe hands I had to pass you over and to place him in
the charge of the one man who from the first never doubted my
innocence.&nbsp; Better a thousand times that my son should be
brought up in a humble station and in ignorance of his
unfortunate father, than that he should learn to share the doubts
and suspicions of his equals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he is really your son!&rdquo; cried my uncle,
staring at Jim in amazement.</p>
<p>For answer the man stretched out his long withered arm, and
placed a gaunt hand upon the shoulder of the actress, whilst she
looked up at him with love in her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I married, Charles, and I kept it secret from my
friends, for I had chosen my wife outside our own circles.&nbsp;
You know the foolish pride which has always been the strongest
part of my nature.&nbsp; I could not bear to avow that which I
had done.&nbsp; It was this neglect upon my part which led to an
estrangement between us, and drove her into habits for which it
is I who am to blame and not she.&nbsp; Yet on account of these
same habits I took the child from her and gave her an allowance
on condition that she did not interfere with it.&nbsp; I had
feared that the boy might receive evil from her, and had never
dreamed in my blindness that she might get good from him.&nbsp;
But I have learned in my miserable life, Charles, that there is a
power which fashions things for us, though we may strive to
thwart it, and that we are in truth driven by an unseen current
towards a certain goal, however much we may deceive ourselves
into thinking that it is our own sails and oars which are
speeding us upon our way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My eyes had been upon the face of my uncle as he listened, but
now as I turned them from him they fell once more upon the thin,
wolfish face of Sir Lothian Hume.&nbsp; He stood near the window,
his grey silhouette thrown up against the square of dusty glass;
and I have never seen such a play of evil passions, of anger, of
jealousy, of disappointed greed upon a human face before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to understand,&rdquo; said he, in a loud, harsh
voice, &ldquo;that this young man claims to be the heir of the
peerage of Avon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is my lawful son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew you fairly well, sir, in our youth; but you will
allow me to observe that neither I nor any friend of yours ever
heard of a wife or a son.&nbsp; I defy Sir Charles Tregellis to
say that he ever dreamed that there was any heir except
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already explained, Sir Lothian, why I kept my
marriage secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have explained, sir; but it is for others in
another place to say if that explanation is
satisfactory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two blazing dark eyes flashed out of the pale haggard face
with as strange and sudden an effect as if a stream of light were
to beat through the windows of a shattered and ruined house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dare to doubt my word?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I demand a proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word is proof to those who know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me, Lord Avon; but I know you, and I see no
reason why I should accept your statement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a brutal speech, and brutally delivered.&nbsp; Lord
Avon staggered forward, and it was only his son on one aide and
his wife on the other who kept his quivering hands from the
throat of his insulter.&nbsp; Sir Lothian recoiled from the pale
fierce face with the black brows, but he still glared angrily
about the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very pretty conspiracy this,&rdquo; he cried,
&ldquo;with a criminal, an actress, and a prize-fighter all
playing their parts.&nbsp; Sir Charles Tregellis, you shall hear
from me again!&nbsp; And you also, my lord!&rdquo;&nbsp; He
turned upon his heel and strode from the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has gone to denounce me,&rdquo; said Lord Avon, a
spasm of wounded pride distorting his features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I bring him back?&rdquo; cried Boy Jim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, let him go.&nbsp; It is as well, for I have
already made up my mind that my duty to you, my son, outweighs
that which I owe, and have at such bitter cost fulfilled, to my
brother and my family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did me an injustice, Ned,&rdquo; said my uncle,
&ldquo;if you thought that I had forgotten you, or that I had
judged you unkindly.&nbsp; If ever I have thought that you had
done this deed&mdash;and how could I doubt the evidence of my own
eyes&mdash;I have always believed that it was at a time when your
mind was unhinged, and when you knew no more of what you were
about than the man who is walking in his sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean when you talk about the evidence of
your own eyes?&rdquo; asked Lord Avon, looking hard at my
uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you, Ned, upon that accursed night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saw me?&nbsp; Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the passage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And doing what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were coming from your brother&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; I
had heard his voice raised in anger and pain only an instant
before.&nbsp; You carried in your hand a bag full of money, and
your face betrayed the utmost agitation.&nbsp; If you can but
explain to me, Ned, how you came to be there, you will take from
my heart a weight which has pressed upon it for all these
years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one now would have recognized in my uncle the man who was
the leader of all the fops of London.&nbsp; In the presence of
this old friend and of the tragedy which girt him round, the veil
of triviality and affectation had been rent, and I felt all my
gratitude towards him deepening for the first time into affection
whilst I watched his pale, anxious face, and the eager hops which
shone in his eyes as he awaited his friend&rsquo;s
explanation.&nbsp; Lord Avon sank his face in his hands, and for
a few moments there was silence in the dim grey room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not wonder now that you were shaken,&rdquo; said
he at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;My God, what a net was cast round
me!&nbsp; Had this vile charge been brought against me, you, my
dearest friend, would have been compelled to tear away the last
doubt as to my guilt.&nbsp; And yet, in spite of what you have
seen, Charles, I am as innocent in the matter as you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank God that I hear you say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you are not satisfied, Charles.&nbsp; I can read it
on your face.&nbsp; You wish to know why an innocent man should
conceal himself for all these years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your word is enough for me, Ned; but the world will
wish this other question answered also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was to save the family honour, Charles.&nbsp; You
know how dear it was to me.&nbsp; I could not clear myself
without proving my brother to have been guilty of the foulest
crime which a gentleman could commit.&nbsp; For eighteen years I
have screened him at the expense of everything which a man could
sacrifice.&nbsp; I have lived a living death which has left me an
old and shattered man when I am but in my fortieth year.&nbsp;
But now when I am faced with the alternative of telling the facts
about my brother, or of wronging my son, I can only act in one
fashion, and the more so since I have reason to hope that a way
may be found by which what I am now about to disclose to you need
never come to the public ear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rose from his chair, and leaning heavily upon his two
supporters, he tottered across the room to the dust-covered
sideboard.&nbsp; There, in the centre of it, was lying that
ill-boding pile of time-stained, mildewed cards, just as Boy Jim
and I had seen them years before.&nbsp; Lord Avon turned them
over with trembling fingers, and then picking up half a dozen, he
brought them to my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Place your finger and thumb upon the left-hand bottom
corner of this card, Charles,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pass
them lightly backwards and forwards, and tell me what you
feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been pricked with a pin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&nbsp; What is the card?&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle turned it over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the king of clubs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try the bottom corner of this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite smooth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the card is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The three of spades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this one?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been pricked.&nbsp; It is the ace of
hearts.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lord Avon hurled them down upon the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you have the whole accursed story!&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Need I go further where every word is an
agony?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see something, but not all.&nbsp; You must continue,
Ned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The frail figure stiffened itself, as though he were visibly
bracing himself for an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell it you, then, once and for ever.&nbsp;
Never again, I trust, will it be necessary for me to open my lips
about the miserable business.&nbsp; You remember our game.&nbsp;
You remember how we lost.&nbsp; You remember how you all retired,
and left me sitting in this very room, and at that very
table.&nbsp; Far from being tired, I was exceedingly wakeful, and
I remained here for an hour or more thinking over the incidents
of the game and the changes which it promised to bring about in
my fortunes.&nbsp; I had, as you will recollect, lost heavily,
and my only consolation was that my own brother had won.&nbsp; I
knew that, owing to his reckless mode of life, he was firmly in
the clutches of the Jews, and I hoped that that which had shaken
my position might have the effect of restoring his.&nbsp; As I
sat there, fingering the cards in an abstracted way, some chance
led me to observe the small needle-pricks which you have just
felt.&nbsp; I went over the packs, and found, to my unspeakable
horror, that any one who was in the secret could hold them in
dealing in such a way as to be able to count the exact number of
high cards which fell to each of his opponents.&nbsp; And then,
with such a flush of shame and disgust as I had never known, I
remembered how my attention had been drawn to my brother&rsquo;s
mode of dealing, its slowness, and the way in which he held each
card by the lower corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not condemn him precipitately.&nbsp; I sat for a
long time calling to mind every incident which could tell one way
or the other.&nbsp; Alas! it all went to confirm me in my first
horrible suspicion, and to turn it into a certainty.&nbsp; My
brother had ordered the packs from Ledbury&rsquo;s, in Bond
Street.&nbsp; They had been for some hours in his chambers.&nbsp;
He had played throughout with a decision which had surprised us
at the time.&nbsp; Above all, I could not conceal from myself
that his past life was not such as to make even so abominable a
crime as this impossible to him.&nbsp; Tingling with anger and
shame, I went straight up that stair, the cards in my hand, and I
taxed him with this lowest and meanest of all the crimes to which
a villain could descend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had not retired to rest, and his ill-gotten gains
were spread out upon the dressing-table.&nbsp; I hardly know what
I said to him, but the facts were so deadly that he did not
attempt to deny his guilt.&nbsp; You will remember, as the only
mitigation of his crime, that he was not yet one and twenty years
of age.&nbsp; My words overwhelmed him.&nbsp; He went on his
knees to me, imploring me to spare him.&nbsp; I told him that out
of consideration for our family I should make no public exposure
of him, but that he must never again in his life lay his hand
upon a card, and that the money which he had won must be returned
next morning with an explanation.&nbsp; It would be social ruin,
he protested.&nbsp; I answered that he must take the consequence
of his own deed.&nbsp; Then and there I burned the papers which
he had won from me, and I replaced in a canvas bag which lay upon
the table all the gold pieces.&nbsp; I would have left the room
without another word, but he clung to me, and tore the ruffle
from my wrist in his attempt to hold me back, and to prevail upon
me to promise to say nothing to you or Sir Lothian Hume.&nbsp; It
was his despairing cry, when he found that I was proof against
all his entreaties, which reached your ears, Charles, and caused
you to open your chamber door and to see me as I returned to my
room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My uncle drew a long sigh of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be clearer!&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the morning I came, as you remember, to your room,
and I returned your money.&nbsp; I did the same to Sir Lothian
Hume.&nbsp; I said nothing of my reasons for doing so, for I
found that I could not bring myself to confess our disgrace to
you.&nbsp; Then came the horrible discovery which has darkened my
life, and which was as great a mystery to me as it has been to
you.&nbsp; I saw that I was suspected, and I saw, also, that even
if I were to clear myself, it could only be done by a public
confession of the infamy of my brother.&nbsp; I shrank from it,
Charles.&nbsp; Any personal suffering seemed to me to be better
than to bring public shame upon a family which has held an
untarnished record through so many centuries.&nbsp; I fled from
my trial, therefore, and disappeared from the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, first of all, it was necessary that I should make
arrangements for the wife and the son, of whose existence you and
my other friends were ignorant.&nbsp; It is with shame, Mary,
that I confess it, and I acknowledge to you that the blame of all
the consequences rests with me rather than with you.&nbsp; At the
time there were reasons, now happily long gone past, which made
me determine that the son was better apart from the mother, whose
absence at that age he would not miss.&nbsp; I would have taken
you into my confidence, Charles, had it not been that your
suspicions had wounded me deeply&mdash;for I did not at that time
understand how strong the reasons were which had prejudiced you
against me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the evening after the tragedy I fled to London, and
arranged that my wife should have a fitting allowance on
condition that she did not interfere with the child.&nbsp; I had,
as you remember, had much to do with Harrison, the prize-fighter,
and I had often had occasion to admire his simple and honest
nature.&nbsp; I took my boy to him now, and I found him, as I
expected, incredulous as to my guilt, and ready to assist me in
any way.&nbsp; At his wife&rsquo;s entreaty he had just retired
from the ring, and was uncertain how he should employ
himself.&nbsp; I was able to fit him up as a smith, on condition
that he should ply his trade at the village of Friar&rsquo;s
Oak.&nbsp; My agreement was that James was to be brought up as
their nephew, and that he should know nothing of his unhappy
parents.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will ask me why I selected Friar&rsquo;s Oak.&nbsp;
It was because I had already chosen my place of concealment; and
if I could not see my boy, it was, at least, some consolation to
know that he was near me.&nbsp; You are aware that this mansion
is one of the oldest in England; but you are not aware that it
has been built with a very special eye to concealment, that there
are no less than two habitable secret chambers, and that the
outer or thicker walls are tunnelled into passages.&nbsp; The
existence of these rooms has always been a family secret, though
it was one which I valued so little that it was only the chance
of my seldom using the house which had prevented me from pointing
them out to some friend.&nbsp; Now I found that a secure retreat
was provided for me in my extremity.&nbsp; I stole down to my own
mansion, entered it at night, and, leaving all that was dear to
me behind, I crept like a rat behind the wainscot, to live out
the remainder of my weary life in solitude and misery.&nbsp; In
this worn face, Charles, and in this grizzled hair, you may read
the diary of my most miserable existence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once a week Harrison used to bring me up provisions,
passing them through the pantry window, which I left open for the
purpose.&nbsp; Sometimes I would steal out at night and walk
under the stars once more, with the cool breeze upon my forehead;
but this I had at last to stop, for I was seen by the rustics,
and rumours of a spirit at Cliffe Royal began to get about.&nbsp;
One night two ghost-hunters&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was I, father,&rdquo; cried Boy Jim; &ldquo;I and my
friend, Rodney Stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it was.&nbsp; Harrison told me so the same
night.&nbsp; I was proud, James, to see that you had the spirit
of the Barringtons, and that I had an heir whose gallantry might
redeem the family blot which I have striven so hard to cover
over.&nbsp; Then came the day when your mother&rsquo;s
kindness&mdash;her mistaken kindness&mdash;gave you the means of
escaping to London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Edward,&rdquo; cried his wife, &ldquo;if you had
seen our boy, like a caged eagle, beating against the bars, you
would have helped to give him even so short a flight as
this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not blame you, Mary.&nbsp; It is possible that I
should have done so.&nbsp; He went to London, and he tried to
open a career for himself by his own strength and courage.&nbsp;
How many of our ancestors have done the same, save only that a
sword-hilt lay in their closed hands; but of them all I do not
know that any have carried themselves more gallantly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I dare swear,&rdquo; said my uncle, heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then, when Harrison at last returned, I learned
that my son was actually matched to fight in a public
prize-battle.&nbsp; That would not do, Charles!&nbsp; It was one
thing to fight as you and I have fought in our youth, and it was
another to compete for a purse of gold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear friend, I would not for the
world&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you would not, Charles.&nbsp; You chose the
best man, and how could you do otherwise?&nbsp; But it would not
do!&nbsp; I determined that the time had come when I should
reveal myself to my son, the more so as there were many signs
that my most unnatural existence had seriously weakened my
health.&nbsp; Chance, or shall I not rather say Providence, had
at last made clear all that had been dark, and given me the means
of establishing my innocence.&nbsp; My wife went yesterday to
bring my boy at last to the side of his unfortunate
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was silence for some time, and then it was my
uncle&rsquo;s voice which broke it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been the most ill-used man in the world,
Ned,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please God we shall have many
years yet in which to make up to you for it.&nbsp; But, after
all, it seems to me that we are as far as ever from learning how
your unfortunate brother met his death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For eighteen years it was as much a mystery to me as to
you, Charles.&nbsp; But now at last the guilt is manifest.&nbsp;
Stand forward, Ambrose, and tell your story as frankly and as
fully as you have told it to me.&rdquo;</p>

340</span>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE VALET&rsquo;S STORY.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> valet had shrunk into the dark
corner of the room, and had remained so motionless that we had
forgotten his presence until, upon this appeal from his former
master, he took a step forward into the light, turning his sallow
face in our direction.&nbsp; His usually impassive features were
in a state of painful agitation, and he spoke slowly and with
hesitation, as though his trembling lips could hardly frame the
words.&nbsp; And yet, so strong is habit, that, even in this
extremity of emotion he assumed the deferential air of the
high-class valet, and his sentences formed themselves in the
sonorous fashion which had struck my attention upon that first
day when the curricle of my uncle had stopped outside my
father&rsquo;s door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lady Avon and gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;if I
have sinned in this matter, and I freely confess that I have done
so, I only know one way in which I can atone for it, and that is
by making the full and complete confession which my noble master,
Lord Avon, has demanded.&nbsp; I assure you, then, that what I am
about to tell you, surprising as it may seem, is the absolute and
undeniable truth concerning the mysterious death of Captain
Barrington.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may seem impossible to you that one in my humble
walk of life should bear a deadly and implacable hatred against a
man in the position of Captain Barrington.&nbsp; You think that
the gulf between is too wide.&nbsp; I can tell you, gentlemen,
that the gulf which can be bridged by unlawful love can be
spanned also by an unlawful hatred, and that upon the day when
this young man stole from me all that made my life worth living,
I vowed to Heaven that I should take from him that foul life of
his, though the deed would cover but the tiniest fraction of the
debt which he owed me.&nbsp; I see that you look askance at me,
Sir Charles Tregellis, but you should pray to God, sir, that you
may never have the chance of finding out what you would yourself
be capable of in the same position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a wonder to all of us to see this man&rsquo;s fiery
nature breaking suddenly through the artificial constraints with
which he held it in check.&nbsp; His short dark hair seemed to
bristle upwards, his eyes glowed with the intensity of his
passion, and his face expressed a malignity of hatred which
neither the death of his enemy nor the lapse of years could
mitigate.&nbsp; The demure servant was gone, and there stood in
his place a deep and dangerous man, one who might be an ardent
lover or a most vindictive foe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were about to be married, she and I, when some black
chance threw him across our path.&nbsp; I do not know by what
base deceptions he lured her away from me.&nbsp; I have heard
that she was only one of many, and that he was an adept at the
art.&nbsp; It was done before ever I knew the danger, and she was
left with her broken heart and her ruined life to return to that
home into which she had brought disgrace and misery.&nbsp; I only
saw her once.&nbsp; She told me that her seducer had burst out
a-laughing when she had reproached him for his perfidy, and I
swore to her that his heart&rsquo;s blood should pay me for that
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was a valet at the time, but I was not yet in the
service of Lord Avon.&nbsp; I applied for and gained that
position with the one idea that it might give me an opportunity
of settling my accounts with his younger brother.&nbsp; And yet
my chance was a terribly long time coming, for many months had
passed before the visit to Cliffe Royal gave me the opportunity
which I longed for by day and dreamed of by night.&nbsp; When it
did come, however, it came in a fashion which was more favourable
to my plans than anything that I had ever ventured to hope
for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Avon was of opinion that no one but himself knew
of the secret passages in Cliffe Royal.&nbsp; In this he was
mistaken.&nbsp; I knew of them&mdash;or, at least, I knew enough
of them to serve my purpose.&nbsp; I need not tell you how, one
day, when preparing the chambers for the guests, an accidental
pressure upon part of the fittings caused a panel to gape in the
woodwork, and showed me a narrow opening in the wall.&nbsp;
Making my way down this, I found that another panel led into a
larger bedroom beyond.&nbsp; That was all I knew, but it was all
that was needed for my purpose.&nbsp; The disposal of the rooms
had been left in my hands, and I arranged that Captain Barrington
should sleep in the larger and I in the smaller.&nbsp; I could
come upon him when I wished, and no one would be the wiser.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then he arrived.&nbsp; How can I describe to you
the fever of impatience in which I lived until the moment should
come for which I had waited and planned.&nbsp; For a night and a
day they gambled, and for a night and a day I counted the minutes
which brought me nearer to my man.&nbsp; They might ring for
fresh wine at what hour they liked, they always found me waiting
and ready, so that this young captain hiccoughed out that I was
the model of all valets.&nbsp; My master advised me to go to
bed.&nbsp; He had noticed my flushed cheek and my bright eyes,
and he set me down as being in a fever.&nbsp; So I was, but it
was a fever which only one medicine could assuage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then at last, very early in the morning, I heard them
push back their chairs, and I knew that their game had at last
come to an end.&nbsp; When I entered the room to receive my
orders, I found that Captain Barrington had already stumbled off
to bed.&nbsp; The others had also retired, and my master was
sitting alone at the table, with his empty bottle and the
scattered cards in front of him.&nbsp; He ordered me angrily to
my room, and this time I obeyed him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My first care was to provide myself with a
weapon.&nbsp; I knew that if I were face to face with him I could
tear his throat out, but I must so arrange that the fashion of
his death should be a noiseless one.&nbsp; There was a hunting
trophy in the hall, and from it I took a straight heavy knife
which I sharpened upon my boot.&nbsp; Then I stole to my room,
and sat waiting upon the side of my bed.&nbsp; I had made up my
mind what I should do.&nbsp; There would be little satisfaction
in killing him if he was not to know whose hand had struck the
blow, or which of his sins it came to avenge.&nbsp; Could I but
bind him and gag him in his drunken sleep, then a prick or two of
my dagger would arouse him to listen to what I had to say to
him.&nbsp; I pictured the look in his eyes as the haze of sleep
cleared slowly away from them, the look of anger turning suddenly
to stark horror as he understood who I was and what I had come
for.&nbsp; It would be the supreme moment of my life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I waited as it seemed to me for at least an hour; but I
had no watch, and my impatience was such that I dare say it
really was little more than a quarter of that time.&nbsp; Then I
rose, removed my shoes, took my knife, and having opened the
panel, slipped silently through.&nbsp; It was not more than
thirty feet that I had to go, but I went inch by inch, for the
old rotten boards snapped like breaking twigs if a sudden weight
was placed upon them.&nbsp; It was, of course, pitch dark, and
very, very slowly I felt my way along.&nbsp; At last I saw a
yellow seam of light glimmering in front of me, and I knew that
it came from the other panel.&nbsp; I was too soon, then, since
he had not extinguished his candles.&nbsp; I had waited many
months, and I could afford to wait another hour, for I did not
wish to do anything precipitately or in a hurry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very necessary to move silently now, since I was
within a few feet of my man, with only the thin wooden partition
between.&nbsp; Age had warped and cracked the boards, so that
when I had at last very stealthily crept my way as far as the
sliding-panel, I found that I could, without any difficulty, see
into the room.&nbsp; Captain Barrington was standing by the
dressing-table with his coat and vest off.&nbsp; A large pile of
sovereigns, and several slips of paper were lying before him, and
he was counting over his gambling gains.&nbsp; His face was
flushed, and he was heavy from want of sleep and from wine.&nbsp;
It rejoiced me to see it, for it meant that his slumber would be
deep, and that all would be made easy for me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was still watching him, when of a sudden I saw him
start, and a terrible expression come upon his face.&nbsp; For an
instant my heart stood still, for I feared that he had in some
way divined my presence.&nbsp; And then I heard the voice of my
master within.&nbsp; I could not see the door by which he had
entered, nor could I see him where he stood, but I heard all that
he had to say.&nbsp; As I watched the captain&rsquo;s face flush
fiery-red, and then turn to a livid white as he listened to those
bitter words which told him of his infamy, my revenge was
sweeter&mdash;far sweeter&mdash;than my most pleasant dreams had
ever pictured it.&nbsp; I saw my master approach the
dressing-table, hold the papers in the flame of the candle, throw
their charred ashes into the grate, and sweep the golden pieces
into a small brown canvas bag.&nbsp; Then, as he turned to leave
the room, the captain seized him by the wrist, imploring him, by
the memory of their mother, to have mercy upon him; and I loved
my master as I saw him drag his sleeve from the grasp of the
clutching fingers, and leave the stricken wretch grovelling upon
the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now I was left with a difficult point to settle,
for it was hard for me to say whether it was better that I should
do that which I had come for, or whether, by holding this
man&rsquo;s guilty secret, I might not have in my hand a keener
and more deadly weapon than my master&rsquo;s
hunting-knife.&nbsp; I was sure that Lord Avon could not and
would not expose him.&nbsp; I knew your sense of family pride too
well, my lord, and I was certain that his secret was safe in your
hands.&nbsp; But I both could and would; and then, when his life
had been blasted, and he had been hounded from his regiment and
from his clubs, it would be time, perhaps, for me to deal in some
other way with him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ambrose, you are a black villain,&rdquo; said my
uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We all have our own feelings, Sir Charles; and you will
permit me to say that a serving-man may resent an injury as much
as a gentleman, though the redress of the duel is denied to
him.&nbsp; But I am telling you frankly, at Lord Avon&rsquo;s
request, all that I thought and did upon that night, and I shall
continue to do so, even if I am not fortunate enough to win your
approval.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Lord Avon had left him, the captain remained for
some time in a kneeling attitude, with his face sunk upon a
chair.&nbsp; Then he rose, and paced slowly up and down the room,
his chin sunk upon his breast.&nbsp; Every now and then he would
pluck at his hair, or shake his clenched hands in the air; and I
saw the moisture glisten upon his brow.&nbsp; For a time I lost
sight of him, and I heard him opening drawer after drawer, as
though he were in search of something.&nbsp; Then he stood over
by his dressing-table again, with his back turned to me.&nbsp;
His head was thrown a little back, and he had both hands up to
the collar of his shirt, as though he were striving to undo
it.&nbsp; And then there was a gush as if a ewer had been upset,
and down he sank upon the ground, with his head in the corner,
twisted round at so strange an angle to his shoulders that one
glimpse of it told me that my man was slipping swiftly from the
clutch in which I had fancied that I held him.&nbsp; I slid my
panel, and was in the room in an instant.&nbsp; His eyelids still
quivered, and it seemed to me, as my gaze met his glazing eyes,
that I could read both recognition and surprise in them.&nbsp; I
laid my knife upon the floor, and I stretched myself out beside
him, that I might whisper in his ear one or two little things of
which I wished to remind him; but even as I did so, he gave a
gasp and was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is singular that I, who had never feared him in
life, should be frightened at him now, and yet when I looked at
him, and saw that all was motionless save the creeping stain upon
the carpet, I was seized with a sudden foolish spasm of terror,
and, catching up my knife, I fled swiftly and silently back to my
own room, closing the panels behind me.&nbsp; It was only when I
had reached it that I found that in my mad haste I had carried
away, not the hunting-knife which I had taken with me, but the
bloody razor which had dropped from the dead man&rsquo;s
hand.&nbsp; This I concealed where no one has ever discovered it;
but my fears would not allow me to go back for the other, as I
might perhaps have done, had I foreseen how terribly its presence
might tell against my master.&nbsp; And that, Lady Avon and
gentlemen, is an exact and honest account of how Captain
Barrington came by his end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And how was it,&rdquo; asked my uncle, angrily,
&ldquo;that you have allowed an innocent man to be persecuted all
these years, when a word from you might have saved
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I had every reason to believe, Sir Charles,
that that would be most unwelcome to Lord Avon.&nbsp; How could I
tell all this without revealing the family scandal which he was
so anxious to conceal?&nbsp; I confess that at the beginning I
did not tell him what I had seen, and my excuse must be that he
disappeared before I had time to determine what I should
do.&nbsp; For many a year, however&mdash;ever since I have been
in your service, Sir Charles&mdash;my conscience tormented me,
and I swore that if ever I should find my old master, I should
reveal everything to him.&nbsp; The chance of my overhearing a
story told by young Mr. Stone here, which showed me that some one
was using the secret chambers of Cliffe Royal, convinced me that
Lord Avon was in hiding there, and I lost no time in seeking him
out and offering to do him all the justice in my
power.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What he says is true,&rdquo; said his master;
&ldquo;but it would have been strange indeed if I had hesitated
to sacrifice a frail life and failing health in a cause for which
I freely surrendered all that youth had to offer.&nbsp; But new
considerations have at last compelled me to alter my
resolution.&nbsp; My son, through ignorance of his true position,
was drifting into a course of life which accorded with his
strength and spirit, but not with the traditions of his
house.&nbsp; Again, I reflected that many of those who knew my
brother had passed away, that all the facts need not come out,
and that my death whilst under the suspicion of such a crime
would cast a deeper stain upon our name than the sin which he had
so terribly expiated.&nbsp; For these reasons&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tramp of several heavy footsteps reverberating through the
old house broke in suddenly upon Lord Avon&rsquo;s words.&nbsp;
His wan face turned even a shade greyer as he heard it, and he
looked piteously to his wife and son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will arrest me!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
must submit to the degradation of an arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This way, Sir James; this way,&rdquo; said the harsh
tones of Sir Lothian Hume from without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not need to be shown the way in a house where I
have drunk many a bottle of good claret,&rdquo; cried a deep
voice in reply; and there in the doorway stood the broad figure
of Squire Ovington in his buckskins and top-boots, a riding-crop
in his hand.&nbsp; Sir Lothian Hume was at his elbow, and I saw
the faces of two country constables peeping over his
shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lord Avon,&rdquo; said the squire, &ldquo;as a
magistrate of the county of Sussex, it is my duty to tell you
that a warrant is held against you for the wilful murder of your
brother, Captain Barrington, in the year 1786.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready to answer the charge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This I tell you as a magistrate.&nbsp; But as a man,
and the Squire of Rougham Grange, I&rsquo;m right glad to see
you, Ned, and here&rsquo;s my hand on it, and never will I
believe that a good Tory like yourself, and a man who could show
his horse&rsquo;s tail to any field in the whole Down county,
would ever be capable of so vile an act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do me justice, James,&rdquo; said Lord Avon,
clasping the broad, brown hand which the country squire had held
out to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am as innocent as you are; and I can
prove it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damned glad I am to hear it, Ned!&nbsp; That is to say,
Lord Avon, that any defence which you may have to make will be
decided upon by your peers and by the laws of your
country.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until which time,&rdquo; added Sir Lothian Hume,
&ldquo;a stout door and a good lock will be the best guarantee
that Lord Avon will be there when called for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The squire&rsquo;s weather-stained face flushed to a deeper
red as he turned upon the Londoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you the magistrate of a county, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not the honour, Sir James.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then how dare you advise a man who has sat on the bench
for nigh twenty years!&nbsp; When I am in doubt, sir, the law
provides me with a clerk with whom I may confer, and I ask no
other assistance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You take too high a tone in this matter, Sir
James.&nbsp; I am not accustomed to be taken to task so
sharply.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor am I accustomed, sir, to be interfered with in my
official duties.&nbsp; I speak as a magistrate, Sir Lothian, but
I am always ready to sustain my opinions as a man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Lothian bowed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will allow me to observe, sir, that I have personal
interests of the highest importance involved in this matter, I
have every reason to believe that there is a conspiracy afoot
which will affect my position as heir to Lord Avon&rsquo;s titles
and estates.&nbsp; I desire his safe custody in order that this
matter may be cleared up, and I call upon you, as a magistrate,
to execute your warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plague take it, Ned!&rdquo; cried the squire, &ldquo;I
would that my clerk Johnson were here, for I would deal as kindly
by you as the law allows; and yet I am, as you hear, called upon
to secure your person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to suggest, sir,&rdquo; said my uncle,
&ldquo;that so long as he is under the personal supervision of
the magistrate, he may be said to be under the care of the law,
and that this condition will be fulfilled if he is under the roof
of Rougham Grange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing could be better,&rdquo; cried the squire,
heartily.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will stay with me, Ned, until this
matter blows over.&nbsp; In other words, Lord Avon, I make myself
responsible, as the representative of the law, that you are held
in safe custody until your person may be required of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours is a true heart, James.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut! it is the due process of the law.&nbsp; I
trust, Sir Lothian Hume, that you find nothing to object to in
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sir Lothian shrugged his shoulders, and looked blackly at the
magistrate.&nbsp; Then he turned to my uncle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a small matter still open between us,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would you kindly give me the name of a
friend?&nbsp; Mr. Corcoran, who is outside in my barouche, would
act for me, and we might meet to-morrow morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With pleasure,&rdquo; answered my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
dare say your father would act for me, nephew?&nbsp; Your friend
may call upon Lieutenant Stone, of Friar&rsquo;s Oak, and the
sooner the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so this strange conference ended.&nbsp; As for me, I had
sprung to the side of the old friend of my boyhood, and was
trying to tell him my joy at his good fortune, and listening to
his assurance that nothing that could ever befall him could
weaken the love that he bore me.&nbsp; My uncle touched me on the
shoulder, and we were about to leave, when Ambrose, whose bronze
mask had been drawn down once more over his fiery passions, came
demurely towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beg your pardon, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;but it shocks me very much to see your cravat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, Ambrose,&rdquo; my uncle answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Lorimer does his best, but I have never been able to fill
your place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be proud to serve you, sir; but you must
acknowledge that Lord Avon has the prior claim.&nbsp; If he will
release me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may go, Ambrose; you may go!&rdquo; cried Lord
Avon.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are an excellent servant, but your
presence has become painful to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, Ned,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;But
you must not leave me so suddenly again, Ambrose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Permit me to explain the reason, sir.&nbsp; I had
determined to give you notice when we reached Brighton; but as we
drove from the village that day, I caught a glimpse of a lady
passing in a phaeton between whom and Lord Avon I was well aware
there was a close intimacy, although I was not certain that she
was actually his wife.&nbsp; Her presence there confirmed me in
my opinion that he was in hiding at Cliffe Royal, and I dropped
from your curricle and followed her at once, in order to lay the
matter before her, and explain how very necessary it was that
Lord Avon should see me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I forgive you for your desertion, Ambrose,&rdquo;
said my uncle; &ldquo;and,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I should be
vastly obliged to you if you would re-arrange my tie.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page355"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
355</span>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE END.</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir James Ovington&rsquo;s</span> carriage
was waiting without, and in it the Avon family, so tragically
separated and so strangely re-united, were borne away to the
squire&rsquo;s hospitable home.&nbsp; When they had gone, my
uncle mounted his curricle, and drove Ambrose and myself to the
village.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We had best see your father at once, nephew,&rdquo;
said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir Lothian and his man started some time
ago.&nbsp; I should be sorry if there should be any hitch in our
meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For my part, I was thinking of our opponent&rsquo;s deadly
reputation as a duellist, and I suppose that my features must
have betrayed my feelings, for my uncle began to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, nephew,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you look as if you
were walking behind my coffin.&nbsp; It is not my first affair,
and I dare bet that it will not be my last.&nbsp; When I fight
near town I usually fire a hundred or so in Manton&rsquo;s back
shop, but I dare say I can find my way to his waistcoat.&nbsp;
But I confess that I am somewhat <i>accabl&eacute;</i>, by all
that has befallen us.&nbsp; To think of my dear old friend being
not only alive, but innocent as well!&nbsp; And that he should
have such a strapping son and heir to carry on the race of
Avon!&nbsp; This will be the last blow to Hume, for I know that
the Jews have given him rope on the score of his
expectations.&nbsp; And you, Ambrose, that you should break out
in such a way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of all the amazing things which had happened, this seemed to
have impressed my uncle most, and he recurred to it again and
again.&nbsp; That a man whom he had come to regard as a machine
for tying cravats and brewing chocolate should suddenly develop
fiery human passions was indeed a prodigy.&nbsp; If his silver
razor-heater had taken to evil ways he could not have been more
astounded.</p>
<p>We were still a hundred yards from the cottage when I saw the
tall, green-coated Mr. Corcoran striding down the garden
path.&nbsp; My father was waiting for us at the door with an
expression of subdued delight upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy to serve you in any way, Sir Charles,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve arranged it for to-morrow at seven
on Ditching Common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish these things could be brought off a little later
in the day,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;One has either to
rise at a perfectly absurd hour, or else to neglect one&rsquo;s
toilet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are stopping across the road at the Friar&rsquo;s
Oak inn, and if you would wish it later&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no; I shall make the effort.&nbsp; Ambrose, you
will bring up the <i>batteris de toilette</i> at five.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether you would care to use my
barkers,&rdquo; said my father.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
&rsquo;em in fourteen actions, and up to thirty yards you
couldn&rsquo;t wish a better tool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, I have my duelling pistols under the
seat.&nbsp; See that the triggers are oiled, Ambrose, for I love
a light pull.&nbsp; Ah, sister Mary, I have brought your boy back
to you, none the worse, I hope, for the dissipations of
town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I need not tell you how my dear mother wept over me and
fondled me, for you who have mothers will know for yourselves,
and you who have not will never understand how warm and snug the
home nest can be.&nbsp; How I had chafed and longed for the
wonders of town, and yet, now that I had seen more than my
wildest dreams had ever deemed possible, my eyes had rested upon
nothing which was so sweet and so restful as our own little
sitting-room, with its terra-cotta-coloured walls, and those
trifles which are so insignificant in themselves, and yet so rich
in memories&mdash;the blow-fish from the Moluccas, the
narwhal&rsquo;s horn from the Arctic, and the picture of the
<i>Ca Ira</i>, with Lord Hotham in chase!&nbsp; How cheery, too,
to see at one side of the shining grate my father with his pipe
and his merry red face, and on the other my mother with her
fingers ever turning and darting with her knitting-needles!&nbsp;
As I looked at them I marvelled that I could ever have longed to
leave them, or that I could bring myself to leave them again.</p>
<p>But leave them I must, and that speedily, as I learned amidst
the boisterous congratulations of my father and the tears of my
mother.&nbsp; He had himself been appointed to the <i>Cato</i>,
64, with post rank, whilst a note had come from Lord Nelson at
Portsmouth to say that a vacancy was open for me if I should
present myself at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your mother has your sea-chest all ready, my lad,
and you can travel down with me to-morrow; for if you are to be
one of Nelson&rsquo;s men, you must show him that you are worthy
of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the Stones have been in the sea-service,&rdquo;
said my mother, apologetically to my uncle, &ldquo;and it is a
great chance that he should enter under Lord Nelson&rsquo;s own
patronage.&nbsp; But we can never forget your kindness, Charles,
in showing our dear Rodney something of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, sister Mary,&rdquo; said my uncle,
graciously, &ldquo;your son has been an excellent companion to
me&mdash;so much so that I fear that I am open to the charge of
having neglected my dear Fidelio.&nbsp; I trust that I bring him
back somewhat more polished than I found him.&nbsp; It would be
folly to call him <i>distingu&eacute;</i>, but he is at least
unobjectionable.&nbsp; Nature has denied him the highest gifts,
and I find him adverse to employing the compensating advantages
of art; but, at least, I have shown him something of life, and I
have taught him a few lessons in finesse and deportment which may
appear to be wasted upon him at present, but which, none the
less, may come back to him in his more mature years.&nbsp; If his
career in town has been a disappointment to me, the reason lies
mainly in the fact that I am foolish enough to measure others by
the standard which I have myself set.&nbsp; I am well disposed
towards him, however, and I consider him eminently adapted for
the profession which he is about to adopt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He held out his sacred snuff-box to me as he spoke, as a
solemn pledge of his goodwill, and, as I look back at him, there
is no moment at which I see him more plainly than that with the
old mischievous light dancing once more in his large intolerant
eyes, one thumb in the armpit of his vest, and the little shining
box held out upon his snow-white palm.&nbsp; He was a type and
leader of a strange breed of men which has vanished away from
England&mdash;the full-blooded, virile buck, exquisite in his
dress, narrow in his thoughts, coarse in his amusements, and
eccentric in his habits.&nbsp; They walk across the bright stage
of English history with their finicky step, their preposterous
cravats, their high collars, their dangling seals, and they
vanish into those dark wings from which there is no return.&nbsp;
The world has outgrown them, and there is no place now for their
strange fashions, their practical jokes, and carefully cultivated
eccentricities.&nbsp; And yet behind this outer veiling of folly,
with which they so carefully draped themselves, they were often
men of strong character and robust personality.&nbsp; The languid
loungers of St. James&rsquo;s were also the yachtsmen of the
Solent, the fine riders of the shires, and the hardy fighters in
many a wayside battle and many a morning frolic.&nbsp; Wellington
picked his best officers from amongst them.&nbsp; They
condescended occasionally to poetry or oratory; and Byron,
Charles James Fox, Sheridan, and Castlereagh, preserved some
reputation amongst them, in spite of their publicity.&nbsp; I
cannot think how the historian of the future can hope to
understand them, when I, who knew one of them so well, and bore
his blood in my veins, could never quite tell how much of him was
real, and how much was due to the affectations which he had
cultivated so long that they had ceased to deserve the
name.&nbsp; Through the chinks of that armour of folly I have
sometimes thought that I had caught a glimpse of a good and true
man within, and it pleases me to hope that I was right.</p>
<p>It was destined that the exciting incidents of that day were
even now not at an end.&nbsp; I had retired early to rest, but it
was impossible for me to sleep, for my mind would turn to Boy Jim
and to the extraordinary change in his position and
prospects.&nbsp; I was still turning and tossing when I heard the
sound of flying hoofs coming down the London Road, and
immediately afterwards the grating of wheels as they pulled up in
front of the inn.&nbsp; My window chanced to be open, for it was
a fresh spring night, and I heard the creak of the inn door, and
a voice asking whether Sir Lothian Hume was within.&nbsp; At the
name I sprang from my bed, and I was in time to see three men,
who had alighted from the carriage, file into the lighted
hall.&nbsp; The two horses were left standing, with the glare of
the open door falling upon their brown shoulders and patient
heads.</p>
<p>Ten minutes may have passed, and then I heard the clatter of
many steps, and a knot of men came clustering through the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not employ violence,&rdquo; said a harsh,
clear voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;On whose suit is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Several suits, sir.&nbsp; They &rsquo;eld over in the
&rsquo;opes that you&rsquo;d pull off the fight this
mornin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Total amounts is twelve thousand
pound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, my man, I have a very important appointment
for seven o&rsquo;clock to-morrow.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll give you
fifty pounds if you will leave me until then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t do it, sir, really.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
more than our places as sheriff&rsquo;s officers is
worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the yellow glare of the carriage-lamp I saw the baronet
look up at our windows, and if hatred could have killed, his eyes
would have been as deadly as his pistol.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t mount the carriage unless you free my
hands,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Old &rsquo;ard, Bill, for &rsquo;e looks
vicious.&nbsp; Let go o&rsquo; one arm at a time!&nbsp; Ah, would
you then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corcoran!&nbsp; Corcoran!&rdquo; screamed a voice, and
I saw a plunge, a struggle, and one frantic figure breaking its
way from the rest.&nbsp; Then came a heavy blow, and down he fell
in the middle of the moonlit road, flapping and jumping among the
dust like a trout new landed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s napped it this time!&nbsp; Get &rsquo;im by
the wrists, Jim!&nbsp; Now, all together!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was hoisted up like a bag of flour, and fell with a brutal
thud into the bottom of the carriage.&nbsp; The three men sprang
in after him, a whip whistled in the darkness, and I had seen the
last that I or any one else, save some charitable visitor to a
debtors&rsquo; gaol, was ever again destined to see of Sir
Lothian Hume, the once fashionable Corinthian.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Lord Avon lived for two years longer&mdash;long enough, with
the help of Ambrose, to fully establish his innocence of the
horrible crime, in the shadow of which he had lived so
long.&nbsp; What he could not clear away, however, was the effect
of those years of morbid and unnatural life spent in the hidden
chambers of the old house; and it was only the devotion of his
wife and of his son which kept the thin and flickering flame of
his life alight.&nbsp; She whom I had known as the play actress
of Anstey Cross became the dowager Lady Avon; whilst Boy Jim, as
dear to me now as when we harried birds&rsquo; nests and tickled
trout together, is now Lord Avon, beloved by his tenantry, the
finest sportsman and the most popular man from the north of the
Weald to the Channel.&nbsp; He was married to the second daughter
of Sir James Ovington; and as I have seen three of his
grandchildren within the week, I fancy that if any of Sir
Lothian&rsquo;s descendants have their eye upon the property,
they are likely to be as disappointed as their ancestor was
before them.&nbsp; The old house of Cliffe Royal has been pulled
down, owing to the terrible family associations which hung round
it, and a beautiful modern building sprang up in its place.&nbsp;
The lodge which stood by the Brighton Road was so dainty with its
trellis-work and its rose bushes that I was not the only visitor
who declared that I had rather be the owner of it than of the
great house amongst the trees.&nbsp; There for many years in a
happy and peaceful old age lived Jack Harrison and his wife,
receiving back in the sunset of their lives the loving care which
they had themselves bestowed.&nbsp; Never again did Champion
Harrison throw his leg over the ropes of a twenty-four-foot ring;
but the story of the great battle between the smith and the West
Countryman is still familiar to old ring-goers, and nothing
pleased him better than to re-fight it all, round by round, as he
sat in the sunshine under his rose-girt porch.&nbsp; But if he
heard the tap of his wife&rsquo;s stick approaching him, his talk
would break off at once into the garden and its prospects, for
she was still haunted by the fear that he would some day go back
to the ring, and she never missed the old man for an hour without
being convinced that he had hobbled off to wrest the belt from
the latest upstart champion.&nbsp; It was at his own very earnest
request that they inscribed &ldquo;He fought the good
fight&rdquo; upon his tombstone, and though I cannot doubt that
he had Black Bank and Crab Wilson in his mind when he asked it,
yet none who knew him would grudge its spiritual meaning as a
summing up of his clean and manly life.</p>
<p>Sir Charles Tregellis continued for some years to show his
scarlet and gold at Newmarket, and his inimitable coats in St.
James&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It was he who invented buttons and loops at
the ends of dress pantaloons, and who broke fresh ground by his
investigation of the comparative merits of isinglass and of
starch in the preparation of shirt-fronts.&nbsp; There are old
fops still lurking in the corners of Arthur&rsquo;s or of
White&rsquo;s who can remember Tregellis&rsquo;s dictum, that a
cravat should be so stiffened that three parts of the length
could be raised by one corner, and the painful schism which
followed when Lord Alvanley and his school contended that a half
was sufficient.&nbsp; Then came the supremacy of Brummell, and
the open breach upon the subject of velvet collars, in which the
town followed the lead of the younger man.&nbsp; My uncle, who
was not born to be second to any one, retired instantly to St.
Albans, and announced that he would make it the centre of fashion
and of society, instead of degenerate London.&nbsp; It chanced,
however, that the mayor and corporation waited upon him with an
address of thanks for his good intentions towards the town, and
that the burgesses, having ordered new coats from London for the
occasion, were all arrayed in velvet collars, which so preyed
upon my uncle&rsquo;s spirits that he took to his bed, and never
showed his face in public again.&nbsp; His money, which had
ruined what might have been a great life, was divided amongst
many bequests, an annuity to his valet, Ambrose, being amongst
them; but enough has come to his sister, my dear mother, to help
to make her old age as sunny and as pleasant as even I could
wish.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>And as for me&mdash;the poor string upon which these beads are
strung&mdash;I dare scarce say another word about myself, lest
this, which I had meant to be the last word of a chapter, should
grow into the first words of a new one.&nbsp; Had I not taken up
my pen to tell you a story of the land, I might, perchance, have
made a better one of the sea; but the one frame cannot hold two
opposite pictures.&nbsp; The day may come when I shall write down
all that I remember of the greatest battle ever fought upon salt
water, and how my father&rsquo;s gallant life was brought to an
end as, with his paint rubbing against a French eighty-gun ship
on one side and a Spanish seventy-four upon the other he stood
eating an apple in the break of his poop.&nbsp; I saw the smoke
banks on that October evening swirl slowly up over the Atlantic
swell, and rise, and rise, until they had shredded into thinnest
air, and lost themselves in the infinite blue of heaven.&nbsp;
And with them rose the cloud which had hung over the country; and
it also thinned and thinned, until God&rsquo;s own sun of peace
and security was shining once more upon us, never more, we hope,
to be bedimmed.</p>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
