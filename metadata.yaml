description: "Rodney Stone is a Gothic mystery and boxing novel by Scottish writer\
  \ Sir Arthur Conan Doyle first published in 1896.\nThe eponymous narrator is a Sussex\
  \ country boy who is taken to London by his uncle Sir Charles Tregellis, a highly\
  \ respected gentleman and arbiter of fashion who is on familiar terms with the most\
  \ important people of Great Britain. The novel interweaves Rodney's coming-of-age\
  \ story with that of his friend Boy Jim's boxing endeavors, and a large portion\
  \ of it deals with the famous bare-knuckle boxers of the late eighteenth and early\
  \ nineteenth century, such as Jem Belcher, John Jackson, Daniel Mendoza, Dutch Sam,\
  \ and others. The book includes vignettes of a number of historical personages,\
  \ notably the Prince Regent, Lord Nelson, Sir John Lade, Lord Cochrane and Beau\
  \ Brummell.\nIt was adapted into a 1913 silent film, The House of Temperley, directed\
  \ by Harold M. Shaw.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
